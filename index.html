But the marriage ceremony may be even more taxing for the girls than their search for a pair of grooms. Sitting still and silent as their guests celebrate and eat is a trial that will push the girls&#39; patience to its limit, not to mention that of Sami and Sarm! As the twins finally make their vows and commit themselves to their husbands, the gravity of the moment finally sets in. Though they have dreamed of marriage for years, only now do they realize that everything in their lives is about to change...Crafted in painstaking detail, Ms. Mori&#39;s pen breathes life into the scenery and architecture of the period in this heart-warming, slice-of-life tale that is at once wholly exotic, yet familiar and accessible through the everyday lives of the characters she has created.</p><p>Kaoru Mori's previous series, <i>Emma</i>, about a maid and a gentleman in Victorian England, has been lauded by <i>Library Journa</i>l and was named to the YALSA Great Graphic Novels list. <b><i>A Bride's Story</i></b> has only broadened her fan base in Japan and the U.S. with its elegant style and delicate story.The time has come for the wedding of Laila and Leily, the high-spirited twins from volume 4 of Mori&#x2019;s series about life on the nineteenth-century Silk Road. Older teens, even though it&#x2019;s unlikely they&#x2019;ll be getting married themselves, will understand the twins&#x2019; nervousness about their life-changing event, and romance fans will appreciate the accepting natures of their young grooms. The last story of the book returns to Amir, the original bride of the series, and her developing feelings for her still very young groom. New readers will want to at least go back to volume 4, but established fans will be thrilled at the continuing beauty of Mori&#x2019;s stunningly illustrated black-and-white comics.

She was born in Omaha, Nebraska, though her parents quickly moved her all over the United States, from the desert in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to the lakeside in Cleveland, Ohio, and several stops in between, eventually settling near Annapolis, Maryland.<br>www.brigidkemmerer.com<br>@BrigidKemmerer</p>Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Juliet and her mother, a globetrotting photojournalist, always sent each other handwritten letters when they were apart. After her mother is killed in a car accident on the way home from the airport, Juliet, an AP English student, continues the practice&#x2014;a coping strategy that her friends and counselors are beginning to question. Declan is an auto shop student who has been court-ordered to clean the cemetery as community service after a drunk-driving incident, and he discovers one of Juliet's letters. He decides to answer it, starting an exchange reminiscent of that in the film You've Got Mail or, more recently, Becky Albertalli's novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda. As the letter writing (and then emailing, chatting, and texting) continues, through pseudonyms, Juliet and Declan learn that they have much in common, but day-to-day life is another story. When they cross paths in both school and the community, their interactions are hostile, a commentary on the way students of different circles and academic levels sometimes view one another. Eventually, though, their facades unravel, and their identities are revealed. Readers will find themselves rooting for the real Declan to win Juliet's heart the same way his online persona did. VERDICT Consider this tale of modern star-crossed love as a first purchase for YA collections.&#x2014;Jillian Woychowski, West Haven High School, CT</p><h2>Best Short Stories (Dover Large Print Classics)</h2><p>William Sydney Porter (1862&#x2013;1910), better known as O.

To Al Qaeda, we are of the Djinn; to the FBI, we are Psychic Spies.<br><br>When the Twin Towers fell, we were likely part of some Hail Mary plan the FBI had -- "break glass in case of major terrorist attack only". They knew about us because we had run slightly afoul of them on a treasure hunting project, then again, every intelligence service knew of us. We were a successful Civilian Remote Viewing think tank developed just after it became declassified.Post 9/11, the FBI brought us in to Remote View future terrorist attacks, and we were successful in helping to prevent another. The odd thing was, even though we were helping prevent terrorist attacks, there was a secretive covert group whose sole job was to shut us down. <br><br>From setups, to death threats, we dodged as much as we could so we could keep working to bring this amazing ability to the world.Being a Remote Viewer can also result in an exorbitant amount of High Strangeness. It opens the door to mind-bending projects which force you to see the world in a completely different light. One moment you're working on predicting markets for a hedge fund, the next, you're an inadvertent contact point to an alien species asking you for help.<br><br>I didn't arrive at Remote Viewing with the belief I had any psychic ability at all. It was, in fact, the words of Mr. Causey ultimately driving me. As a child, he warned me to always remember the time before words - the moment before thought is created. This obsession sent me on a journey to explore my consciousness and to know the self, where it left me to live in a Zen Center, while running a team of Remote Viewers.</p><p></p><h2>Cooking Apicius</h2><p>Sally Grainger has gathered, in one convenient volume, her modern interpretations of 64 of the recipes in the original text. This is not recipes inspired by the old Romans&#x2019; but rather a serious effort to convert the extremely gnomic instructions in the Latin into something that can be reproduced in the modern kitchen which actually gives some idea of what the Romans might have eaten. Sally Grainger, therefore, has taken great pains to suggest means of replicating the particular Roman taste for fermented fish sauce. It may sound unpleasant, but actually is not too far removed from the fish sauces of the Far East and any reproduction of Roman cookery must depend on getting this particular aspect right.</p><p>Apicius was a Roman scholar.</p><h2>Spill: Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity</h2><p>In <i>Spill</i>, self-described queer Black troublemaker and Black feminist love evangelist Alexis Pauline Gumbs presents a commanding collection of scenes depicting fugitive Black women and girls seeking freedom from gendered violence and racism. In this poetic work inspired by Hortense Spillers, Gumbs offers an alternative approach to Black feminist literary criticism, historiography, and the interactive practice of relating to the words of Black feminist thinkers. Gumbs not only speaks to the spiritual, bodily, and otherworldly experience of Black women but also allows readers to imagine new possibilities for poetry as a portal for understanding and deepening feminist theory.</p><p>Alexis Pauline Gumbs is a poet, independent scholar, and activist. She is coeditor of <i>Revolutionary Mothering: Love on the Front Lines</i> and the Founder and Director of Eternal Summer of the Black Feminist Mind, an educational program based in Durham, North Carolina."Gumbs&#x2019;s writing has luscious urgency and rhythmic drive, which will make it of interest beyond its titular audience." -- Barbara Hoffert, <i>Library Journal</i> Published On: 2016-10-15<br><br>"<i>Spill</i> is not just a poetic collection where art meets criticism or where art is criticism. Instead, it is an intricately woven, polyvocal, ever-expansive map that details and gives rise to new and old black feminisms instructing us how to live and move with(in) these proliferating epistemologies." -- Sasha Panaram, <i>New Black Man (In Exile)</i> Published On: 2017-01-02<br><br>"Inspired by the work of black feminist intellectual Hortense Spillers, Gumbs&#x2019; collection of poems appear as a series of powerful scenarios. Reading the volume is akin to being a member of a theatre audience. The fourth wall is peeled away and one is suddenly witness to heartbreaking, inspiring and insightful scenes depicting fugitive black women and girls &#x2013; unsung and celebrated 'sheroes' &#x2013; seeking freedom from gendered violence and racism."<br> &nbsp; -- Thomasi McDonald, <i>News &amp; Observer</i> Published On: 2017-03-18<br><br>"<i>Spill</i> is poetry that invites the reader to imagine these poems weren't written- they was lived, they were felt, and in some deep sense, re-membered. In other words, this book happened in somebody's body, a body committed to Black Feminist ways of knowing and feeling in the world.... By embracing and applying these through the form of the parable, <i>Spill </i>speaks to the radical, spiritual power that belongs to those 'black women who made and broke narrative.'" -- Lara Mimosa Montes, <i>Poetry Project Review</i> Published On: 2017-04-01<br><br>"Gumbs&#x2019;s poetry takes up the detritus of the everyday that surrounds theory &#x2014; the affective social and political worlds in which black feminist theorists write &#x2014; and bends it, splits it, like a prism breaking a beam of light into a rainbow." -- Maria Velazquez, <i>Cascadia Subduction Zone</i> Published On: 2017-04-01<br><br>"Gumbs seamlessly moves between historic reference, inherited memories, and a series of visions or a journal of dreams-the result is bigger than text itself. Her writing blurs the lines between past, present, and future. The book communes with ancestral knowledge while offering conjectures of what could be, reminding us that Black women have always seen what comes next, past the edges of what seemed or seems possible.... <i>Spill</i> is first and foremost a love offering to all Black women, but all readers who bear witness will leave its pages knowing of radical imagined possibilities and the difficult path laid before us toward elsewhere: 'our work here is not done.'" -- Zaina Alsous, <i>Bitch</i> Published On: 2017-06-01<br><br>"This book is a commanding collection of scenes depicting fugitive Black women and girls seeking freedom from gendered violence and racism. Like Audre Lorde, Gumbs writes for the complexity of her vision." -- Jaki Shelton Green, <i>NBC News (NBCBlk)</i> Published On: 2017-10-23<br><br>"Blending my love of Black queer feminist authors with genre bending and analytically complex poetry, Gumbs&#x2019;s work inflicted pleasantly unfamiliar feelings upon me that I cannot 'claim to have invented.' <i>Spill</i> transformed me from a reluctant bystander of theory and poetry into a willing and enthused participant.... Alexis Pauline Gumbs&#x2019;s <i>Spill</i> is an offering for all seeking an unpredictable and experimental journey of Black feminist artistic expression and self-discovery." -- Eden Sena Kokui Segbefia, <i>Scalawag</i> Published On: 2018-02-01<br><br>"Gumbs not only speaks to the spiritual, bodily and otherworldly experience of black women, she allows readers to imagine new possibilities for poetry as a portal for understanding and deepening feminist theory.", <i>Triangle Tribune</i> Published On: 2016-07-17</p><h2>Gatekeepers (Dreamhouse Kings, 3)</h2><p>With their mother still missing after going through a Civil War time portal in their spooky house, and their father in jail under a false accusation, Xander, David, and their younger sister continue to try to bring their mother back, now with the help of an old relative who has turned up unexpectedly.</p><p>&#34;To call the Dreamhouse Kings series a young adult novel is not to do this splendid tale justice.

But they all share the same roots in Mesoamerica's natural bounty and human culture.<br><br> The drink is tequila&#x2014;more properly, <i>mescal de tequila,</i> the first mescal to be codified and recognized by its geographic origin and the only one known internationally by that name. In <i>�Tequila! A Natural and Cultural History,</i> Ana G. Valenzuela-Zapata, the leading agronomist in Mexico's tequila industry, and Gary Paul Nabhan, one of America's most respected ethnobotanists, plumb the myth of tequila as they introduce the natural history, economics, and cultural significance of the plants cultivated for its production.<br><br> Valenzuela-Zapata and Nabhan take you into the agave fields of Mexico to convey their passion for the century plant and its popular by-product. In the labor-intensive business of producing quality mescal, the cultivation of <i>tequila azul</i> is maintained through traditional techniques passed down over generations. They tell how <i>jimadores</i> seek out the mature agaves, strip the leaves, and remove the heavy heads from the field; then they reveal how the roasting and fermentation process brings out the flavors that cosmopolitan palates crave.<br><br> Today in Oaxaca it's not unusual to find small-scale mescal-makers vending their wares in the market plaza, while in Jalisco the scale of distillation facilities found near the town of Tequila would be unrecognizable to old Jos� Cuervo. Valenzuela-Zapata and Nabhan trace tequila's progress from its modest beginnings to one of the world's favored spirits, tell how innovations from cross-cultural exchanges made fortunes for Cuervo and other distillers, and explain how the meteoric rise in tequila prices is due to an epidemic&#x2014;one they predicted would occur&#x2014;linked to the industry's cultivation of just one type of agave.<br><br> The tequila industry today markets more than four hundred distinct products through a variety of strategies that heighten the liquor's mystique, and this book will educate readers about the grades of tequila, from blanco to a�ejo, and marks of distinction for connoisseurs who pay up to two thousand dollars for a bottle. <i>�Tequila! A Natural and Cultural History</i> will feed anyone's passion for the gift of the blue agave as it heightens their appreciation for its rich heritage.</p><p>A MacArthur Fellow and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Conservation Biology, Gary Paul Nabhan is Director of the Center for Sustainable Environments at Northern Arizona University."No mere barroom reference, this heady blend of agricultural history, Mescalero anthropology, Aztec mythology and nature writing is an appealing package for researchers and drinkers alike." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>"A richly textured picture of tequila and the agave plant . . . Readers interested in the natural history and ethnography of the Southwest will enjoy it, as will tequila fanciers who want to learn about the history and manufacture of their drink." &#x2014;<i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>"Lyricism for all things agave infuses the prose, a rhapsody tempered by hard botanical science." &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>"A scholarly yet entertaining guide to the history and husbandry of this phenomenal beverage . . . For most readers, tequila may be better sipped than studied. But since a little tequila goes a long way, this book can provide an alternate, albeit less intoxicating, form of pleasure." &#x2014;<i>Natural History</i>"This slender tome contains virtually everything you could want to know about tequila." &#x2014;<i>New Mexico Magazine</i></p><h2>The Royal Succession (The Accursed Kings) (Book 4)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This is the original Game of Thrones.&#x201d; George R.R.

Reading encompasses notes to a 5th above and a 5th below Middle C. The notes A and E are introduced first, played by a braced 3rd finger of each hand. This encourages free movement of the whole arm from the shoulder, and develops a natural, balanced hand position, before the 5-finger position is gradually mastered. The first line of the treble staff and the fifth line of the bass staff are highlighted, and further lines are similarly treated as the child learns more notes. Staccato, slurs, ties, upbeats, and repeat signs are all experienced in Book 1. Tempo and dynamic markings encourage musical playing, and are in English, in order to avoid &#34;knowledge overload.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Every Day a Friday: How to Be Happier 7 Days a Week</h2><p><b>Experience the joy of God's message and begin each day with a positive outlook with these words of wisdom from Lakewood Church pastor and #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Joel Osteen.</b><br>Research that shows people are happiest on Fridays.

And where there are people, there is a plethora of relationships. Many of these relationships bring joy, while others are fraught and frustrated. This raises questions about when and how to turn to psychological relationship theories for assistance. When we hold a high view of the Bible's wisdom, we want to take care to ensure that secular ideas do not contradict or replace biblical guidance.</p><p>This book provides a strong intellectual consideration of where Bowen theory may be compatible with a biblical view and where it may be in tension. Additionally, it discusses the usefulness of Dr Murray Bowen's theory to the practical aspects of working with different relationships in Christian ministries. We trust it provides rich fodder for grappling with family systems, or indeed any secular theory, as it relates to Christian ministry and biblical truth.</p></p><p>B Soc Stud., MSc., PhD.

But the threat of over-fishing, combined with climate change and pollution, is endangering a way of life, not only in Gloucester but in coastal cities all over the world. And yet, according to Kurlansky, it doesn't have to be this way. Engagingly written and filled with rich history, delicious anecdotes, colorful characters, and local recipes, <i>The Last Fish Tale</i> is Kurlansky's most urgent story, "an engrossing multi-layered portrait of a fishing community that can be read for pure pleasure as well as being a campaigning plea for the environment" (Financial Times).</p><p>Mark Kurlansky is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of many books, including <i>The Food of a Younger Land</i>, <i>Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World</i>; <i>Salt: A World History</i>; <i>1968: The Year That Rocked the World</i>; and <i>The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell</i>.

A fish tale exaggerates to make things look bigger. It is triumphal. When in the early seventeenth century George Waymouth reported that the cod caught off New England were five feet long with a three-foot circumference, this may have been a fish tale. We don&#x2019;t know. Surely the Reverend Francis Higginson&#x2019;s reports from Salem in 1630 that lions had been seen running wild in Cape Ann, or that the squirrels could fly from tree to tree, were fish tales.<br><br>A Gloucester story is just the opposite. It is a story of miserable irony in which things are shown in their worst light, a story with a sad ending.<br><br>Often the history of a place begins with the person who named it. But in the case of Gloucester, the story begins with the men who didn&#x2019;t&#x2014; the ones who tried to name it and failed. The naming of Gloucester is an entire cycle of Gloucester stories.<br><br>The earliest Europeans to arrive at what is today Cape Ann are thought to have been the Vikings, who, according to the written Icelandic legends known as the Sagas, sailed in 1004 down the North American coast from Labrador to Newfoundland to a place they called Vineland. For a long time it was debated whether to believe this story. But in 1961 the remains of eight Viking turf houses dating to the year 1000 were found in a place in Newfoundland known as L&#x2019;Anse aux Meadows. Where, then, was Vineland? Today many historians believe that it was the coastline of New England, named after the wild grapes that grew there. According to another story, in 1004, Leif Ericson&#x2019;s brother Thorwald landed on Cape Ann and named it Cape of the Cross. But neither the name nor Thorwald went far. Thorwald died on the expedition and those historians who believe the story at all think that he is buried somewhere on Cape Ann. And that is the first Gloucester story.<br><br>In 1606, Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer of the coast of Maine, sailed down to Cape Ann, and seeing three islands off its tip&#x2014; now called Thachers, Milk, and Straitsmouth Islands&#x2014;he named the peninsula with the great gray granite boulders marking its headlands, the Cape of Three Islands, which even if said in French, Cap aux Trois �les, is not much of a name. He noted that there were actually two rocky headlands and a passage between them, which he sailed through taking depth soundings as he went, thus charting the course that fishermen home from the sea have been using ever since&#x2014;from Thachers around East Gloucester to Eastern Point, into the harbor between West and East Gloucester. Champlain thought this was an extraordinary harbor, deep and sheltered with ample mooring space, and he spent three months charting it. He named it Le Beau Port, which was a little more poetic than the Cape of Three Islands, but was destined to be no more durable. Being a skilled seaman, he found anchorage in the safest, most leeward cove in the harbor, but that was not to bear his name either. Instead, the sheltered nook is known today as Smith Cove, named after the young English adventurer, thirty- four-year-old Captain John Smith, who arrived eight years later, in 1614.<br><br>This Englishman was very different from Champlain. Though they both were prodigious writers, Champlain&#x2019;s writing revealed little about the man or his life. It is not even certain what year he was born. But Smith&#x2019;s writings are very much about himself, full of praise for his own extraordinary deeds. Historians, distrustful of Smith&#x2019;s braggadocio, tended not to believe what he wrote. Only in recent years has it come to be understood that most of his yarns of daredevil adventures are true.<br><br>Smith was a self-made man in more than one sense of that phrase. He not only made his own way in the world&#x2014;though always assisted by his remarkable ability to attract the patronage of the wealthy&#x2014;but he also used his writings to establish a colorful persona for himself.<br><br>When he was still a teenager he went off to the Lowlands, as did many adventurous young Englishmen, to help the Protestant Dutch fight for their freedom from the despotic Roman Catholics of Spain. The savage combat of that war produced many disillusioned young veterans for the new colonies. But Smith, after three years of fighting the Catholics, did not cross the Atlantic and instead joined the Austrian army to fight the Turks, the true infidels, in Hungary.<br><br>According to his immodest but generally accurate journals, Smith showed great cunning and courage and was rapidly promoted to the rank of captain, but then was captured by the Turks, who sent him into slavery in Turkey. There he found himself owned by an aristocratic woman whom he called &#x201c;the young Charatza Tragabigzanda.&#x201d; According to Smith, her name meant &#x201c;girl from Trebizond.&#x201d; Smith and his &#x201c;fair mistress,&#x201d; as he put it, developed some kind of friendship and it seemed a happy time until she gave him to her brother. The exact nature of Smith&#x2019;s relationship with his fair mistress is unclear, but throughout his life he would be rescued and befriended by young women of social standing. Many historians believe that Tragabigzanda had sent him to her brother to learn their language and customs&#x2014;she had communicated with Smith in Italian&#x2014;and that her plan was then to marry him. But Smith either did not understand or did not think much of this plan. He murdered her brother and escaped, traveling by horse to the Ukraine, then Poland, and on to Western Europe.<br><br>colonialism was the great opportunity for young English adventurers of the early seventeenth century. There were no traditions and few rules, and a resourceful young man could invent as he went along. Smith was personally involved in the two most important British colonies in North America, Virginia and Massachusetts. At the time, Virginia was seen as the more promising and it was the one that attracted sponsors and investors. But Smith believed that New England had better prospects for the future. The reason for this, he argued, was its wealth of fish. Smith maintained that New England fish were a natural resource worth more than gold. &#x201c;The sea is better than the richest mine known,&#x201d; he wrote.<br><br>This stance was surprising in an age of exploration dominated by highborn men who considered themselves above such activities as fishing and bringing fish to market. The traditional source of wealth for the great men of the Age of Exploration was gold.<br><br>It was his 1614 voyage that had convinced Smith of the importance of fishing. Having never been a man of affluence, one of the goals of his voyage was to somehow get rich. He had hoped to find gold but could find none. He then tried whaling, but did not encounter a suitable species. The only thing left was fishing, an activity he despised. So he ordered his men to go fishing, while he had himself and a crew lowered in a small boat to begin charting the coast, an activity he had developed a great fondness for in the Chesapeake. The little boat would move into every inlet and measure its nooks and turns, sounding depths so that their value for future ships would be documented.<br><br>Smith charted the coastline with great accuracy from the mouth of the Kennebec in Maine to Cape Cod and tried to name everything as he went. The British had simply referred to the area as part of Virginia, and it was Smith who gave it the name New England. But less successful were some of his other names. The island off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that he dubbed Smyth&#x2019;s Iles&#x2014;his creative spelling, farfetched even for its day, would become infamous among latter historians&#x2014;is today the Isles of Shoals. His name for the granite- studded peninsula, today Cape Ann, was Tragabigzanda, and he called the three islands the Three Turks&#x2019; Heads in remembrance of three Turks whom he beheaded in duels six months before his capture.<br><br>Along the way, always looking for a little profit, he picked up fur pelts. He identified and sounded twenty-five &#x201c;excellent good harbors,&#x201d; but for reasons that are not clear he neglected to sound the harbor on the tip of Tragabigzanda, perhaps because Champlain had already done so. He did name the points along the tip of the coast including Halibut Point, which still bears the name, though while it is known as an excellent spot for catching striped bass and sometimes bluefish, there is no record of its ever being a place to land halibut.<br><br>Smith returned to Europe not only with his charts but also with seven thousand &#x201c;green cod,&#x201d; or salted fish, and forty thousand stockfish, or dried cod, that his men had landed off of Monhegan Island in southern Maine. England had recently opened trade with Europe and Smith was able to sell the fish in M�laga, where the price was high. M�laga also had a slave market, where he was able to sell twenty- seven locals whom he had lured onto his ship in New England.<br><br>The slave sale did not receive wide attention, but the reputed fortune he made on the fish became legendary. Some years later Massachusetts Governor William Bradford heard that it had been 60,000 fish, a fish tale. The fish, the map, the name New England&#x2014;all made a strong impression back in England. In fact, it was this story combined with Smith&#x2019;s map that convinced the exiled Pilgrims in Holland to start their colony in Smith&#x2019;s New England.<br><br>It was not a moment too soon, according to Smith. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while explorers were searching for gold and spice routes, fortunes were being made on fishing, especially fishing cod. France and England were to fight repeated wars to secure control of North America&#x2019;s fish.<br><br>In an age without refrigeration, the fish that was eaten by most people was salt cured. Cod, a large and plentiful fish with white, flaky flesh, a high degree of protein, and almost no fat, was considered the best fish to salt cure. Sixty percent of the fish eaten in Europe was salt-cured cod.<br><br>Since mariners did not know how to measure longitude, it was difficult to measure east-to-west progress on Atlantic crossings. Latitude, on the other hand, was easily fixed by the stars and so sailors knew where they were from north to south. So the easiest way to cross the Atlantic was to pick up a wind, fix the latitude, and stay on it, which was called &#x201c;westing&#x201d; and &#x201c;easting.&#x201d; The French wested to Nova Scotia and the English to Newfoundland and Labrador. Only the Basques and the Portuguese could have wested to New England. But they didn&#x2019;t, perhaps because the Basques while pursuing whales had by chance discovered the more northerly cod grounds years earlier.<br><br>Europeans had been fixed on fishing in northern latitudes, but by the second decade of the seventeenth century, this was changing. As the fishing moved south Europeans discovered a basic truth of marine life. While cold waters are richer in nutrients, and therefore have more plentiful and more desirable fish species, these species grow faster and larger in the southern part of their range. The southern part of the range of the Atlantic cod is New England.<br><br>In 1602, Bartholomew Gosnold, an Englishman who worked with Smith a few years later in establishing a settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, crossed the Atlantic in search of the by-then old and often disproved theory that there was a westward passage to China. It is extraordinary how much evidence it took to convince Europeans that North America was very large and in the way. Realizing that there was no route to China around Nova Scotia, Gosnold followed the coastline south as far as Narragansett Bay. Along the way he noted not only the plentitude of cod&#x2014;he said they constantly &#x201c;pestered&#x201d; his vessel, which may be another fish story&#x2014;but also that the schools swam in more shallow water, closer to shore, and that the fish were far bigger than those to the north. He renamed the peninsula that the Italian, Giovanni da Verazzano, had named Pallavisino after an Italian general. Gosnold called it Cape Cod, and that was one name Smith did not try to change.<br><br>The following year fish merchants in Bristol sent out two vessels to confirm Gosnold&#x2019;s findings and their commander, Martin Pring, concurred that the fishing in New England was better than in Newfoundland and that there was an abundance of rocky coastline, ideally suited for laying out salted fish to dry in the sun.<br><br>But meanwhile the French in Nova Scotia were also mov-ing down the coast, enticed by impressive catches landed by Basques from St. Jean- de-Luz. Smith wanted to make more voyages to New England. On the second voyage he planned to establish a settlement but failed to reach New England; in his third attempt in 1615 he was captured by French pirates, escaped, returned to England where he settled down and wrote books, and never crossed the Atlantic again.<br><br>And so it was an important step for the English when, in 1620, a group of religious fanatics&#x2014;Smith&#x2019;s map in hand&#x2014;set sail, not for Virginia as is often said but for &#x201c;Northern Virginia,&#x201d; for John Smith&#x2019;s New England, and specifically for a place called Cape Cod, where they would build their religious colony and support it with fishing. Because Smith had overlooked Gloucester Harbor, or maybe just because one peninsula was called Cape Cod and the other Tragabigzanda, settlement began in Plymouth, on Cape Cod and not in Gloucester. It was becoming clear that to promote the new lands, having the right name was critical.<br><br>As they crossed the Atlantic, there were several things the Pilgrims did not know. One was how to fish. Another was that a monopoly on New England fishing had been decreed that, if enforced, would stop them from fishing. Had the long-argued measure been passed a few months earlier, the Pilgrims might have gone somewhere else, denying the English their first real foothold in New England.<br><br>Earlier attempts by the English to settle New England had failed. In 1607, English settlers in Maine had built New England&#x2019;s first transatlantic vessel, which they used to flee their settlement for England, declaring New England uninhabitable. In the first decade there was a great deal of discussion about whether &#x201c;over-cold&#x201d; New England was habitable at all.</p><h2>Naoki Urasawa&#39;s 20th Century Boys, Vol. 2: The Prophet (2)</h2><p>R to L (Japanese Style)<br><br>Failed rock musician Kenji's memories of his past come rushing back when one of his childhood friends mysteriously commits suicide.

Reprint.</p><p>Ages 6 and up. This book was first published 25 years ago but has been reissued with a new introduction by Lawrence. Combining a spare, rhythmic text with a stunning series of narrative paintings, it tells the story of Harriet Tubman, who escaped from slavery but returned to the South 19 times to lead more than 300 people to freedom in the North. "Some were afraid, / But none turned back, / For close at their heels / Howled the bloodhound pack." Like the words, the pictures are full of urgency and directed movement; the figures--stark, strong, and simplified--blend in shape and color with the forest world that hides them and helps them escape to the North. Harriet is like a great protective angel; her brown hand, huge and powerful, is like the spreading roots and branches of the trees. And always the North Star shines at the top edge of the painting to light the runaways' flight to freedom. In word and image, Lawrence shows and tells how story can inspire you: Harriet as a child heard the story of Moses; Lawrence as a child heard about Harriet; now his book tells children about this strong brave woman who led her people on the "perilous journey" to the Promised Land. <i>Hazel Rochman</i>This powerful tribute to the courage of Harriet Tubman provides an ideal introduction to the work of African American artist Lawrence. Tubman's life is dramatically portrayed in stunning artwork, bold with bright blocks of color and informed by a keen sense of symmetry. As Tubman leads slaves to freedom, their cloaks of red, yellow and vivid blue are illuminated against the landscape. Lawrence's paintings honor their subjects; they are alive with a movement and complexity that contrast well with the sparse simplicity of the text. Brief verse pares Tubman's experiences to their essence. The text seems simple ("Harriet, Harriet, / Born a slave, / Work for your master, / From your cradle / To your grave"), yet it resonates with a wealth of emotions--anger, fear, jubilation. The rhythmic pulse of the verse conveys constant danger, the howl of a bloodhound pack closing in. This moving and beautiful book will stimulate interest in the artist as well as in his subject.

Nineteen-year-old Alice Mitchell had planned to pass as a man in order to marry her seventeen-year-old fianc�e Freda Ward, but when their love letters were discovered, they were forbidden from ever speaking again. Freda adjusted to this fate with an ease that stunned a heartbroken Alice. Her desperation grew with each unanswered letter&#x2015;and her father's razor soon went missing. On January 25, Alice publicly slashed her ex-fianc�e's throat. Her same-sex love was deemed insane by her father that very night, and medical experts agreed: This was a dangerous and incurable perversion. As the courtroom was expanded to accommodate national interest, Alice spent months in jail&#x2015;including the night that three of her fellow prisoners were lynched (an event which captured the attention of journalist and civil rights activist Ida B. Wells). After a jury of "the finest men in Memphis" declared Alice insane, she was remanded to an asylum, where she died under mysterious circumstances just a few years later. <em>Alice + Freda Forever </em>recounts this tragic, real-life love story with over 100 illustrated love letters, maps, artifacts, historical documents, newspaper articles, courtroom proceedings, and intimate, domestic scenes.</p></p><p><p><strong>Alexis Coe </strong>has written columns for <em>The Awl</em>, <em>SF Weekly</em>, and <em>The Toast</em>.

Both books are immaculately researched and enticingly written, the sort that you'll stay up all night reading with a flashlight under the covers. Coe previously interviewed Abbott for The Toast (where she is a columnist), so we wanted to see what would happen if Abbott interviewed Coe. Click through to read the resulting interview.<br>In 1892, America was obsessed with a teenaged murderess, but it wasn't her crime that shocked the nation &#x2015; it was her motivation. Nineteen-year-old Alice Mitchell had planned to pass as a man to marry her seventeen-year-old fianc�e Freda Ward, but when their love letters were discovered, they were forbidden from ever speaking again. Heartbroken and desperate, Alice filched her father's razor and, in broad daylight on a winter afternoon, slashed her ex-lover's throat.<br>In her new book, Alice + Freda Forever, historian Alexis Coe recounts their story "with the color and liveliness of a novel" (The New Yorker). The book is also an Amazon Best Book of the Month. Coe talked to Flavorwire about the women's illicit relationship, Alice's lurid crime, and a trial that enthralled &#x2015; and confounded &#x2015; 19th-century America.<br>Karen Abbott: In the introduction, you talk about carrying around this story for a long time. What kept you interested?<br>Alexis Coe: I wasn't just a historian who stumbled upon a provocative, forgotten piece of history. Alice and Freda became people I cared about, and I was upset over the injustice both faced. Obviously Alice committed an unconscionable crime, but both of the young women died when they were so young, and had so little control over their lives and their legacy. By not telling their story, I almost felt complicit in silencing them.<br>How did the insanity plea come about?<br>alice and freda foreverAlice's father, George Mitchell, was such a dangerous man. He had a successful track record of peremptorily diagnosing women in his family. He'd placed his wife, Isabella, in a hospital after she gave birth on three separate occasions, deeming what was probably postpartum depression unsuitable for a wife and mother. In the 1890s, committable behavior included a new mother's resistance to sex soon after birth. Once in the hospital, Isabella supposedly passed from melancholia to insanity to acute mania, and after two months of restraint, she was finally released. She expected be reunited with her two month old infant, but she returned to an empty bassinet. In her absence, and perhaps as a result of it, the infant died. If she dared mourn, George would once again have her institutionalized. She gave birth to seven children during her lifetime. Four survived to adulthood.<br>On the very night Alice killed a perfectly healthy seventeen-year-old woman in broad daylight, with plenty of witnesses and evidence to prove it was premeditated, George convinced two of the most formidable lawyers in Tennessee that his daughter could not be tried for murder. At that point, Alice's hands were covered in blood. George wasn't denying that his daughter killed Freda, but he couldn't accept her motivation. Alice was never ashamed of her relationship with Freda, and was forthcoming about their intention to marry, and that she killed Freda because she loved her, and could not stand the thought of anyone else having her. In 1892, Alice's explanation wasn't just inconceivable to them &#x2015; it seemed nothing short of insane.<br>ADVERTISING<br>inRead invented by Teads<br><br>How did Isabella's mental health history factor into the case?<br>The defense painstakingly reviewed Isabella's hospitalizations in order to establish hereditary history, a requirement of the insanity plea. They argued that when Isabella had Alice, she passed on her insanity to her daughter. Physically. This was salient point in a nineteenth century courtroom. These accounts were then printed and debated in all the newspapers. As you can imagine, Isabella, while spoken of often, rarely made public appearances after Alice's arrest.<br>The defense seemed so flimsy. How was it so successful?<br>That was the brilliance of the insanity plea! The evidence didn't need to make sense, it just needed to offer some kind of explanation for what seemed inexplicable. No one wanted to believe that this was simply a crime of passion, and that such passion could exist between two women. They wanted to believe that Alice, a white woman from a respectable family, was a sympathetic victim of her own illness. In Madness and Civilization, Michel Foucault argued that physicians who sought to define reason were also silencing unreason. It was a handy way to regulate whole classes of people society deemed deviant.<br>The only voice of reason in all of this was George Peters, the Attorney General, but he was really ineffective. It wasn't for lack of effort. No medical expert in the entire state of Tennessee would testify that Alice's same-sex love wasn't insane.<br>Was the case forgotten after Alice was sent to the asylum?<br>Alice lived on in the medical community. She inspired a lot of articles linking same-sex love to violence, and due to the verdict, insanity. One article in a medical journal used Alice as an example of why all people who display such "perversion" should be castrated, no matter gender or class.<br>Was it difficult to spend so much time on such a tragic story?<br>Oh, yes. I kept experiencing their relationship over and over again, from happy days to dark ones. The love letters were particularly difficult, and I reread them often. I obviously knew what was happening, but that knowledge never lessened my reactions. There were several threatening episodes long before the murder, and with each one, I saw so many opportunities for Freda to save herself. One night, she woke up to Alice clutching a bottle of poison. She was sharing a bed with someone who was contemplating killing her, and drama continued the next day. Why did Freda stay in bed with Alice? Why didn't she tell someone?<br>LiarThat being said, there was plenty of wry humor. The chapter headings are lifted from primary sources, which allowed me to name one "Erotomania" and another "Sexual Monsters." I found comic relief in nineteenth century phrases, many of which I now unsuccessfully attempt to use in conversation. When I hear a crazy theory, I exclaim, that's the "ebullition of a crank!" I could also illuminate the more ridiculous moments in the text and through illustrations. I catalogued the absurd evidence used by medical experts to support Alice's insanity plea, and then had Sally Klann, my illustrator, list them above a few hapless looking doctors. Their faulty reasoning included: She is left-handed. Her face is larger on side than the other. She intended to commit suicide, but forgot. She is weak minded. She dominated the mind of Freda Ward.<br>If Alice was weak minded, how she dominate the mind of Freda Ward?<br>That's something I often ask aloud, much to my dog's confusion. The defense and medical experts were trying to link same-sex love to insanity, and that ridiculous contention called for a lot of unstable arguments and conclusions. At times, it seemed like they were just throwing things against the wall to see what stuck.<br>You have a detailed chapter on the use of media, and local papers' relationship to men who played major roles in the Mitchell-Ward case. Conflict of interest?<br>The middle to upper class white men in Memphis stuck together! Alice's attorneys and judge had all worked at or invested in the local newspapers. Articles and letters to the editor were splashed across pages for half of 1892, and definitely influenced the jury. Some reporters were clearly pandering, which seemed to accomplish several goals. When one paper praised the jury, whose "chivalry exceeds their sense of justice," they considered it a compliment, but it was also a directive. Alice's father was well liked and respected in Memphis, and the court could not possibly impugn the honor of a well-bred young lady by branding her a criminal.<br>These men also knew each other in municipal capacities, and from the KKK. Alice's judge, Julius DuBose was one of the foundering members of the Tennessee Ku Klux Klan. Alice was in the same jail as the victims of the infamous People's Grocery lynching. They'd dared open a market in the Curve, a densely populated black neighborhood that already had one grocer. He was white, and didn't like the competition. Rumor has it that DuBose was at the lynching, and I'm inclined to believe it. I don't think the angry mob had any trouble getting the Sheriff to hand over Calvin McDowell, Thomas Moss, and Henry Steward. DuBose knew the jailers well, and possibly had his own set of keys. After all, he presided over all the cases in that jail.<br>Is the case well known in Memphis?<br>Alice and Freda's plots are a part of the tour at Elmwood Cemetery, a gothic, creeptastic place. I went back several times to take in the elaborate headstones. Some look like bathtubs, and others resemble monuments.<br>Outside of Elmwood and research institutions, Alice and Freda's story is not well known. Memphis history tends to focus on Civil War, their catastrophic Yellow Fever outbreaks, the assassination of Martin Luther King and, of course, Elvis. I tried to spread the word when I was researching there, and reactions were diverse &#x2015; and a few were quite shocking. I was unprepared for the assumptions thrust in my direction about my sexual preference, and there were just a couple of hateful comments &#x2015; not unlike what I saw posted outside Baptist churches.<br>Most Southerners, however, are far too polite to say such things, and the majority was eager to learn more, which was really encouraging at the beginning of such a massive undertaking. An archivist in Nashville had my favorite reaction: "Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit!"<br>How do you think the book will be received in Memphis?<br>I'm eager to find out! I've been doing a lot of phone interviews with journalists in Memphis, and they seem excited to discover this significant, forgotten part of their history. I arrive the day after the book hits stores, and my tight schedule suggests they're at least curious. I hope I don't hear anyone say, "Bless your heart." That's not a good thing.<br>Will people make connections between the past and the present?<br>I found Alice and Freda's world sadly familiar. The most acrid arguments and language used by opponents of same-sex marriage today are almost identical to the ones used to describe Alice and Freda's relationship in 1892: Unnatural. Perverse. Pointless without progeny. I'm continually amazed that, over 120 years later, a marriage between Alice and Freda would still be illegal in Tennessee.<br>Will there be Alice+Freda Forever, the movie?<br>I get asked that all the time! My literary agent at William Morris Endeavor is handling the tv/film rights, so the book is in good hands. I'll admit I've imagined Saoirse Ronan as Alice.<br>Karen Abbott is the New York Times bestselling author of Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy: Four Women Undercover in the Civil War.</p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"Coe, a columnist for <em>The Awl</em>, sheds light on one of the most lurid murder trials of the late-19th century, in this lively, provocative history. Prior to January of 1892, Alice Mitchell had planned on wedding her 17-year-old lover, Freda Ward. The two teenagers devised a plan in which Alice would try to pass as a man. But when their love letters were uncovered and the two were separated, a heartbroken Alice brutally murdered her ex-fianc�e. As the details of their relationship were revealed during the subsequent media frenzy and trial, the American public struggled to comprehend the then-unspoken-of concept of same-sex love. But as Coe shows, the affair between Alice and Freda started as a socially-acceptable bond between two women, before deepening into something far more profound, bordering on outright insanity (known then as eratomania). Gender politics and societal expectations brought undue pressure on the romance, and Alice's fate (institutionalized, dying soon after from consumption) is somehow mysterious. It's an odd, even unsettling look at cultural attitudes of the 1890s. Coe argues that Alice acted not as a frustrated lesbian, but as a dangerous person just waiting for the right trigger. The author addresses the many cultural issues entangled in the controversy, providing impressively compact, albeit not expansive, coverage of the event. It's a well-written effort that <strong>makes the most of its source material on two levels, both as true crime and as social commentary.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The year was 1892, and 19-year-old Alice Mitchell was in love with Freda Ward, 17. She determined that if she couldn't marry Freda, nobody else would, either. The two women devised a plan to marry, with Alice posing as a man. However, their scheme was uncovered, and their families forbade the relationship. Freda moved on with her life and discovered other loves. Alice was unable to accept life without Freda and decided to kill her former lover when she visited Memphis. This true-crime drama uses primary-source documents of letters and transcripts from the trial to provide a rich, detailed description of Alice's successful murder plot and the events following the verdict that declared Alice insane and sentenced her to an asylum. This is <strong>a captivating account, and readers will quickly become absorbed in the suspense surrounding Freda's murder. </strong>Additionally, the book provides a foundation for discussion of sociocultural themes, such as how LGBT relationships have historically been viewed by society, gender and femininity, and even journalism."&#x2015;starred, <em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The story of a Gilded Age-era homicide that stunned a nation with its sheer violence and tabooed origins. Haunted for years about the case, media columnist and historian Coe chronicles a 19th-century, Memphis, Tennessee-based ordeal of coldblooded murder and the jilted lesbian love that inspired it. As teenagers who fell in love in 1892, Alice Mitchell and Freda Ward threw caution to the wind, exchanged rings and anticipated marital bliss. Coe recounts their illicit affair through love letters, graphic artwork and entrancing detail as Alice, the more enamored partner when compared to the flirtatious, fickle Freda, became enraged when she learned of her fiancee's heterosexual infidelities. After a failed poisoning and an attempt to dress as a man to legally consummate their nuptials, their missives were intercepted and the relationship exposed. Forbidden from contact, the women drifted apart, yet Alice, angered and despondent, watched and waited for the perfect opportunity to approach Freda and slash her throat in public. Being the Victorian era, this type of savage crime of passion provoked sensationalistic front-page 'creative reporting,' especially as same-sex attraction was just beginning to be recognized as psychologically sound and not classified as perverse 'erotomania.' An insanity plea fueled a frenzied courtroom staffed by an all-white, male jury and a lunacy inquisition, which sentenced Alice to be institutionalized.

Gigi Kennedy seems to have it all together&#x2014;except her teenage daughter has turned into a hostile stranger and her husband is running for Congress, which means her old skeletons are in danger of being brought into the light.<br> <br> Then a new family moves to this quiet, tree-lined cul-de-sac. Tessa Campbell seems friendly enough to the other mothers, if a bit reserved. Then the neighbors notice that no one is ever invited to Tessa&#x2019;s house. And soon, it becomes clear that Tessa is hiding the biggest secret of all.</p><p>Sarah Pekkanen&nbsp;is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Ever After</i>, <i>The Opposite of Me, Skipping a Beat, These Girls, The Best of Us, Catching Air, </i><i>Things You Won&#x2019;t Say</i>, and <i>The Perfect Neighbors</i>.

You don&#x2019;t want to be late for the bus on the first day!&#x201d; Susan Barrett called up the stairs.<br> <br>She grabbed the leash hanging on a hook in the coat closet and her shaggy gray mutt, Sparky, who had supersonic hearing when it came to the rattle of a leash or the creak of the oven door opening, came running, his nails scrabbling against the wooden floors.<br> <br>Susan ran through a quick mental checklist: Cole&#x2019;s new Spider-Man lunchbox was packed inside his matching Spider-�Man backpack. A sheaf of three-ring paper filled his binder. His water bottle had been rinsed and filled.<br> <br>She checked her watch. Sparky looked hopefully up the stairs. And Cole finally came racing down, his face clean but his shirt on backward.<br> <br>Susan expertly flipped it around and they stepped outside into the golden September air. Later it would grow very warm, but right now the weather was mild and clear. This was the best part of Susan&#x2019;s morning, the few minutes she and Cole spent ambling to the bus stop, calling out hello to neighbors while Sparky greeted his canine pals. At the beginning of a fresh day, it was easy to make resolutions: She wouldn&#x2019;t eat carbs. She&#x2019;d go to bed at a decent hour. She&#x2019;d stop stalking her ex-husband, Randall, and his awful girlfriend.<br> <br>A dozen yards ahead was her best friend, Kellie, shepherding along her daughter, Mia, and her son, Noah, who was conveniently Cole&#x2019;s best pal. As Susan drew closer, she heard Kellie saying, &#x201c;Just try two bites of a granola bar. Two little bites! I&#x2019;ll pay you a dollar . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How come I don&#x2019;t get paid for eating?&#x201d; Cole asked Susan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh God, pretend you didn&#x2019;t hear that,&#x201d; Kellie said to Susan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Scott, you said &#x2018;God,&#x2019; &#x201d; Cole informed her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon,&#x201d; Kellie said, winking, as Susan shrugged. Who knew where Cole had picked up that chiding tone? Maybe from Randall&#x2019;s girlfriend; when in doubt, Susan found it convenient to assign her blame.<br> <br>As Cole ran ahead to catch up with Noah, Kellie moved over to let Susan walk alongside her. But Kellie nearly stumbled as a sidewalk crack snagged one of her shoes.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long does it take to get used to walking in high heels when you&#x2019;ve been in flip-flops for a decade?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks,&#x201d; Susan said instantly. She and Kellie had an ongoing game in which they delivered bogus answers with complete authority. It had started when one of the kids&#x2014;Susan couldn&#x2019;t remember which one&#x2014;had asked where Santa went on summer vacation. &#x201c;Australia,&#x201d; Susan had said, at the exact moment Kellie had responded, &#x201c;Bermuda.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You made that up. It&#x2019;s already been five weeks. Now tell me the truth, is this outfit okay?&#x201d; Kellie asked. &#x201c;Does it say I&#x2019;m trustworthy yet savvy, the sort of woman you need to buy a house from? Mia, honey, don&#x2019;t pick that flower. It&#x2019;s part of Mrs. Henderson&#x2019;s garden.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I would never pick someone else&#x2019;s flower. That would be illegal,&#x201d; Mia huffed. Ten-year-old Mia had a dozen Girl Scout badges and was certified by the Red Cross as a mother&#x2019;s helper, facts she didn&#x2019;t so much tell people as accost them with.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look great,&#x201d; Susan told Kellie honestly. She could see hints of the high school cheerleader Kellie had been in her heart-shaped face and thick blond hair. Kellie had been in the popular crowd, Susan knew, but she was one of the nice girls: the kind of teenager who&#x2019;d ridden on a homecoming float, flashing a dimpled smile to the crowd, and whose yearbook pages were filled with notes from friends. Susan had had a very different experience in high school. She&#x2019;d been one of only nine black students in her graduating class, and she&#x2019;d spent most of her Friday nights with a book for company. (&#x201c;You were class valedictorian, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Kellie had asked after Susan had slaughtered everyone in Scrabble on game night. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; Susan had protested, honestly. She&#x2019;d been salutatorian.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my gosh! Look!&#x201d; Kellie said.<br> <br>She grabbed Susan&#x2019;s arm and pointed across the street, to the empty house with the SOLD! sign staked in the front lawn. Ever since Mrs. Brannon had died of cancer and her husband had moved into an assisted living facility, the Cape Cod had seemed lonely. Sure, the lawn was kept trimmed and the gutters were cleaned. But missing were all the little touches that had made it a home. Mr. Brannon&#x2019;s polished walking stick was absent from its usual spot by the front door, and the flowerpots that had once held Mrs. Brannon&#x2019;s begonias had been removed from the steps. The well-used wooden rocking chairs had disappeared from the porch. Now, though, the house was thrumming with activity, awakening again.<br> <br>A silver minivan was parked in the driveway and a huge moving van laid claim to the curb, its back doors flung open. Three men were wrestling a couch down a ramp. The house&#x2019;s windows were open, and a soccer ball lay in the front yard.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw that couch in Crate and Barrel a while ago, but it was three thousand bucks, which guarantees Cole would spill grape juice on it the first day,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you say they have a couple of kids? What are they doing with a three-�thousand-dollar couch? In cream, no less?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they like to live dangerously,&#x201d; Kellie said. &#x201c;And look, they&#x2019;re at the bus stop already. Tessa!&#x201d;<br> <br>Kellie gave a little jump as she waved, nearly turning her ankle as she landed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did I say two weeks? I meant two months,&#x201d; Susan said.<br> <br>Tessa, who&#x2019;d been standing at the bus stop flanked by her daughter and son, a little apart from the other families gathered there, was waving back. A tentative smile broke across her face. Tessa looked nervous, Susan thought. It was tough moving to a new town.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re here!&#x201d; Kellie said when they reached Tessa.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; agreed Tessa. She was a woman composed of edges, the sort a child might draw, Susan thought, taking in her blunt-cut hair, her sharp chin, and her straight, dark eyebrows. Tessa was enviably slender in her khakis and simple blue blouse. Susan made a mental note: No carbs or sugar today!<br> <br>&#x201c;We got into town this weekend,&#x201d; Tessa was saying. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been staying at the Marriott but we&#x2019;ll be in the house tonight since the furniture just arrived.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Susan Barrett. Welcome to the neighborhood,&#x201d; Susan said, offering her hand. &#x201c;How old are your kids?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bree is nine,&#x201d; Tessa said, touching her daughter&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;And Addison just turned seven.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both kids had that scrubbed, first-day-of-school look. New clothes with the creases still showing, combed hair, clean backpacks. Except Addison was trying to hide a fat, wiggling worm in his pocket. That detail alone made her sure that he and Cole would become fast friends.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great names,&#x201d; Kellie said. &#x201c;And Addison&#x2019;s the same age as Noah and Cole! Who&#x2019;s his teacher?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um . . . Miss Klopson, I think?&#x201d; Tessa said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s who Noah and Cole have!&#x201d; Susan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s wonderful,&#x201d; Tessa said. But her smile seemed to require an effort. Her expression, like her voice, was flat&#x2014;�almost restrained. Was she sick? Or maybe she was just wiped out from the move, Susan thought.<br> <br>There was a little awkward pause, then Mia tugged on �Kellie&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Can I interview them?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Kellie said to Tessa. &#x201c;Sorry, Mia writes the &#x2018;Kids&#x2019; Corner&#x2019; column for our neighborhood newsletter. Would you mind if she asked you a few quick questions?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um . . . sure?&#x201d; Tessa said. She tucked her hair behind her ears and frowned. Mia was already digging into her backpack for her official reporter&#x2019;s steno notebook and pen.<br> <br>Mia cleared her throat and uncapped her pen. &#x201c;First question,&#x201d; she said. Some of the other parents and kids turned at the sound of her voice ringing out. &#x201c;WHY did you move here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa staggered back, as if she&#x2019;d been pushed.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>Kellie stepped forward, steadying Tessa by her arm. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re about to faint.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t eat any breakfast.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; Kellie said. She dug in her purse and came up with the granola bar she&#x2019;d been unsuccessfully pushing on her kids. &#x201c;Try this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is she going to get paid for eating it?&#x201d; Cole wanted to know.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shh,&#x201d; Susan said. She grabbed Cole&#x2019;s water bottle from his backpack and offered it to Tessa. He could drink from the fountains for a day.<br> <br>Tessa took a small sip. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. I was just dizzy for a moment, but it passed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to ask my &#x2018;w&#x2019; questions,&#x201d; Mia insisted. &#x201c;Who, what, where, why, and when.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mia, quiet,&#x201d; Kellie said.<br> <br>Tessa didn&#x2019;t look better, Susan thought. She was still ashen. It was a good thing Kellie hadn&#x2019;t let go of her arm.<br> <br>Susan was about to suggest that Tessa sit down when a little boy shouted, &#x201c;Bus! Bus!&#x201d;<br> <br>Parents exploded into activity, kissing children, retying loose shoelaces, shouting reminders about piano lessons and soccer practice, and waving as the kids climbed aboard. Susan touched her index finger to the corner of her eye, then her heart, then pointed it at Cole. I. Love. You. She saw his smile through the bus window, then the vehicle lumbered away, belching a cloud of exhaust. The group of parents echoed the noise with an equally loud sigh of relief. They peeled away, heading to the blissful quiet of their offices or homes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you up to walking?&#x201d; Kellie asked Tessa. &#x201c;We can wait here with you if you&#x2019;re still shaky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, really, I&#x2019;m much better now,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;I should get back and check on the movers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re heading in the same direction, so we&#x2019;ll give you all the neighborhood gossip on the way,&#x201d; Kellie said. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t believe the scandals. The intrigue!&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan punched Kellie in the arm. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s kidding. We&#x2019;re actually quite boring.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadly, it&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Kellie said. &#x201c;Well, we do have our ladies-�only Wine and Whine night, and that tends to inspire some unexpected confessions, but other than that we&#x2019;re a pretty tame bunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to join us at the next one,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Gigi&#x2019;s turn to host, and she&#x2019;s your next-door neighbor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you met her yet?&#x201d; Kellie asked. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the one with the Susan Sarandon vibe? Picture Thelma just before she and Louise drove off that cliff. Gigi&#x2019;s husband, Joe, is running for Congress in the special election&#x2014;our congressman resigned because of a sex scandal with a prostitute, you might&#x2019;ve heard&#x2014;and Joe&#x2019;s always busy campaigning so you probably won&#x2019;t see him much, but Gigi&#x2019;s really great.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa gave them a faint smile. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s my house.&#x201d; She handed the superhero water bottle back to Susan. &#x201c;Thank you again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan watched as Tessa walked up the front steps and disappeared inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;I repulsed her, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; Kellie asked. &#x201c;I always babble too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re charming,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;I bet she&#x2019;s getting the flu.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what did you think of her?&#x201d; Kellie asked as they resumed strolling.<br> <br>&#x201c;A spotless beige couch with two kids?&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;It screams &#x2018;control freak,&#x2019; but I&#x2019;m reserving judgment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She seems . . . pleasant, I guess,&#x201d; Kellie said. &#x201c;But shy. She was like that when I met her at the open house, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Susan shrugged. &#x201c;Busy day today?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadly, no,&#x201d; Kellie sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a single listing yet. I earned a little something for helping with the Brannons&#x2019; house, but I wasn&#x2019;t the main agent on it. I&#x2019;ve been working for a solid month and I&#x2019;ve barely recouped the costs I spent to get licensed and for my business cards.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just starting out,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; Kellie said. &#x201c;How long did it take you? I mean before your business really exploded?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, a little while,&#x201d; Susan said vaguely. She didn&#x2019;t want to tell her friend that her company, Your Other Daughter, had been an instant success. Susan&#x2019;s idea for a part-time job coordinating services for the elderly, like taking them to �doctors&#x2019; appointments or visiting them in nursing homes, had somehow grown into a booming franchise in four states. Early on, there had been an article about her in Black Enterprise magazine, and then a write-up in the Duke alumni magazine, which had helped launch her company. Now she had a syndicated weekly radio show in which she dispensed advice about elder care to callers. She gave speeches at five hundred dollars a pop. Even Mr. Brannon had become one of her clients; she&#x2019;d helped the widower sort through his accumulated decades of belongings and choose an assisted living center. She visited Mr. Brannon every week to make sure he was comfortable. That service was off the books; Mr. Brannon, with his courtly manners and sad smile, had a special place in her heart. He seemed so alone in the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll spread rumors about asbestos at Wine and Whine night, to get the neighbors we don&#x2019;t like to move away, and then I can sell their houses,&#x201d; Kellie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great idea,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring a few bottles of Chardonnay. Last time Gigi ran out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe she didn&#x2019;t think it would be good for her husband&#x2019;s congressional campaign to have a dozen drunk women lurching out of his house,&#x201d; Kellie mused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on, it never hurt Bill Clinton,&#x201d; Susan said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s this for a plan: we&#x2019;ll get Tessa drunk and she&#x2019;ll spill all her deep, dark secrets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in,&#x201d; Kellie said, laughing.</p><h2>The New Rebellion (Star Wars)</h2><p>Award-winning author Kristine Kathryn Rusch brings her remarkable talents to the <i>Star Wars(r)</i> universe, where the New Republic faces sudden and total annihilation....<br><br>Somewhere in the galaxy, millions suddenly perish--a disruption of the Force so shocking it is felt by Luke at his Jedi academy and by Leia on Coruscant.&nbsp;&nbsp;While Leia must deal with an assassination attempt, a rumored plot against the New Republic, and allegations that Han Solo is involved, Luke seeks out a former Jedi student who may hold the key to the mass destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Brakiss is only the bait in a deadly trap set by a master of the dark side who is determined to rule as emperor.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's targeted Luke, Leia, and Leia's Jedi children to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then billions will follow, in a holocaust unequaled in galactic history.</p><p><p>Rave reviews for previous <i>Star Wars(r)</i> adventures...</p><p><i>The Jedi Academy Trilogy</i> by Kevin J.

After his military service, he attended Jacksonville (Fla.) University where he earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in history and government in 1962.&nbsp;He began his journalism career at the&nbsp;<i>Florida Times Union</i>&nbsp;in Jacksonville while attending college and subsequently worked at the&nbsp;<i>Jacksonville Journal</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Rochester Times Union</i>, and Rochester&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Democrat &amp; Chronicle</i>. In September 1982, when&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i>&nbsp;began publication, Jack Williams served as the weather page editor.In 1992, as Hurricane Andrew battered Dade County, Williams was in the National Hurricane Center, which was on the fringe of the strongest winds. He has flown into three hurricanes and has chased tornadoes with researchers. In January 1999 Williams was one of the half dozen journalists selected by the National Science Foundation to report on research in Antarctica.He is the author of <i>The USA Today Weather Book</i>, which won The American Meteorological Society&#x2019;s Louis J. Battan Author&#x2019;s Award, and <i>The USA Today Weather Almanac.</i>The oft-disparaged USA Today has influenced the American press most notably in its thorough, graphic approach to weather. This book, written by the founding editor of the newspaper's weather page and illustrated by its artists, taps that expertise. Useful both as a reference work and a browse, the book presents a wealth of information, making complex ideas--such as why wind directions change with altitude--accessible through colorful maps and graphics. Chapters cover everything from storms to droughts, with a look at weather forecasting as well as the diversity of our country's weather. The chapters include interesting tidbits such as the effect of heat on an airplane's takeoff distance and the importance of seeking higher ground during a flood. Boxed sidebars examine weather disasters and profile weather scientists such as Jack Parrish, who flies into hurricanes to study them. In the margins Williams offers weather factoids such as Eskimo names for snow. Only infrequently does the newspaper's cutesy style grate, such as in a graphic headlined "Inside the Sun: Our Life-Giving Inferno." Included are a glossary and weather record for all 50 states. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Miss Kopp&#39;s Midnight Confessions (A Kopp Sisters Novel, 3)</h2><p><b>The best-selling author of <i>Girl Waits with Gun</i> and <i>Lady Cop Makes Trouble</i> continues her extraordinary journey into the lives of the fabulous Kopp sisters.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perfect for book groups.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i>Booklist</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stewart has another winner on her hands.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Suspense Magazine</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Constance Kopp is back&#x2014;with a badge and a taste for justice.

The most comprehensive retrospective of the artist's work ever produces.</p><p>Andrew Wyeth is perhaps the most popular American artist of the twentieth century. He has been the subject of numerous major exhibitions, including ones at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. Many books have been published on his art. <br><br>Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the former editor-in-chief of Connoisseur, is a cultural affairs consultant and the author of many books, including Making the Mummies Dance, his recent bestselling memoirs. A new book about art fakes will be published shortly.<br>Here, the legendary American realist painter looks back at six decades of his work. This comprehensive retrospective that originated in Japan and is now on view in Kansas City, Missouri, includes both famous and recent paintings. An artistic independent, Wyeth pictures a different view of reality than does, say, Norman Rockwell. Thomas Hoving introduces the book and observes that Wyeth "has always painted for himself." Thus, Wyeth's comments on the origins and events of each painting are of particular interest. The quality of the printing is very good, avoiding the pitfalls of too much high contrast and loss of shadow detail in the pictures. But best of all are the stories Wyeth tells. Sure to appeal to both general and informed readers, this is recommended for the autobiography and art collections of public and academic libraries.?Andy Murphy, Charleston P.L., S.C.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Magic and Showmanship: A Handbook for Conjurers (Dover Magic Books)</h2><p>Like theatrical presentations, conjuring is an art of illusion. A magician skilled in the craft is able to convince an audience that he or she can read minds, communicate with the spirit world, make objects appear or disappear, and perform other acts of seemingly genuine magic. Without having mastered the art of presentation or &#x201c;showmanship,&#x201d; however, even the most competent sleight-of-hand artist can fall short in performance. With this in mind, noted authority Henning Nelms goes beyond the basics to show how techniques developed for the stage by playwrights, directors, and actors can heighten the dramatic effect of a magician&#x2019;s performance.<br>In this instructive book, Helms analyzes every phase of conjuring &#x2014; from sleights, devices, and illusions to misdirection, controlling the audience&#x2019;s attention, incorporating &#x201c;patter,&#x201d; and the effective use of assistants. Of particular interest is a chapter on body language, posture, positioning and movement. Also included are some 60 original routines &#x2014; from simple card tricks to such major illusions as having the performer suddenly appear at stage center.<br>Indispensable as an instruction manual for novices, this how-to guide &#x2014; enhanced with nearly 200 of the author&#x2019;s illustrations &#x2014; will also serve as a lasting source of advice and inspiration for veteran conjurers.</p><p></p><h2>The Test</h2><p><p><b>Award-winning author Sylvain Neuvel explores an immigration dystopia in <i>The Test</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br>Britain, the not-too-distant future.<br>Idir is sitting the British Citizenship Test.<br>He wants his family to belong.</p><p>Twenty-five questions to determine their fate.

In this all-new companion volume, Eldridge goes beyond those insights and shifts her focus to parents, offering them much-needed encouragement and hope.</p><p><b>Adoption is a sensitive and personal subject.&nbsp;</b>My research is based not only on the interviews with 100 adoptive parents, but also the 160 adoptees that share their hearts and stories everyday on our all-adoptee online group (all-adoptee@yahoogroups.com). Take what helps and toss the rest.<b>Foreword, by Gregory C. Keck, Ph.D.</b><br>I have read Sherrie Eldridge's other books and have talked with her for years. We have undertaken so many discussions about issues in adoption, it is amazing that we have not resolved everything that complicates adoption. Unfortunately, we have not nor has anyone else. All of us in the adoption arena continue to look for not only creative but effective ways to remedy the many problems facing everyone in the adoption world -- the adoption triad (the adoptee, the birth parents, and the adoptive parent) and the many professionals with whom they interact. When Sherrie approached me about writing a forewordI have read Sherrie Eldridge's other books and have talked with her for years. We have undertaken so many discussions about issues in adoption, it is amazing that we have not resolved everything that complicates adoption. Unfortunately, we have not nor has anyone else. All of us in the adoption arena continue to look for not only creative but effective ways to remedy the many problems facing everyone in the adoption world -- the adoption triad (the adoptee, the birth parents, and the adoptive parent) and the many professionals with whom they interact. When Sherrie approached me about writing a foreword for the sequel to the original Twenty Things, I enthusiastically agreed even though I had just finished a year of my own writing.The reader will be very quickly engaged by Sherrie's early pages; by page thirteen, I was sending her an email saying how much I liked what she wrote. I think it is uncommon for a person doing a foreword to comment about the author's choice of a title, however, I am driven to do just that. By about page twenty, Eldridge had already addressed twenty things....by the end of the book, I felt as if she had provided wise insights into about 20,000 things that would be helpful for adoptive parents and simultaneously for their children.&nbsp;<br>Twenty Things Adoptive Parents Need to Succeed is uniquely poised to be helpful to everyone involved in adoption. As an adoptive parent, I found this book profoundly moving -- particularly when I think that Sherrie, an adoptee, provides absolute validation for adoptive parents and thus for adoption. Too many individuals in the adoption triad represent only their perspective when writing or discussing issues related to adoption. Sherrie's well-integrated presentation provides an essential bridge for all members of the triad as well as for adoption professionals. She attends to each perspective with respect, grace and sensitivity. She lures the reader into not only what she is discussing but into their own stories, feelings and experiences; again, as a parent, I found myself on somewhat of an emotional roller coaster, but then so comfortable with where the ride took me.&nbsp;<br>As a professional in the field of attachment and bonding, and as Founder of the Attachment and Bonding Center of Ohio, I specialize in working with adoptive families whose children have experienced early trauma. I have also co-authored of Parenting the Hurt Child: Helping Adoptive Families Heal and Grow (2002) and "Adopting the Hurt Child: Hope for Families with Special Needs Kids" (1995) with Regina Kupecky, LSW. In addition, I am involved in training regarding attachment disorders, both nationally and internationally.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I found that Sherrie provides sound information based on research, family anecdotes, and existing adoption literature. For years we have referred to children with special needs; Eldridge enumerates the special needs that adoptive parents have. What an interesting and refreshing dimension! In fact, much of what Sherrie shares with her readers will allow them to reframe their current understanding of their own parenting. The reader may experience a sense of disequilibrium, as personal feelings they thought were resolved, emerge again; not to worry however, as you read on you will find a new level of understanding and resolution.<br>Each chapter ends with some ideas for further discussion and tasks, which facilitate the reader's understanding of the content just presented. It is a unique way to close one chapter and prepare for entry into another. Readers can use this book in smorgasbord format. Take a look at the table of contents, take an inventory of your own needs, and find your way to the chapter that will address your concerns and help you move on.<br>&nbsp;Parents will feel validated, perhaps, even vindicated by how Sherrie defines successful adoptive parenting. The world over-examines adoptive families; they are judged by very different standards than families built by birth. They are told either adoption is not an issue with the child's difficulty in school or that adoption has everything to do with the child's academic progress or lack thereof. Each adoptive family can use Twenty Things to help them assess just what adoption has to do with specific situations they face; they then can proceed to tackle the situation in a manner that will help them and their child.<br>Now, begin turning the pages...find your way through a journey of understanding, insight, feeling, and empowerment that will confirm that you ARE an effective and successful adoptive parent. Most importantly, have as much fun as you can with your children. &nbsp;As Sherrie says, "Much more is caught than taught!" I couldn't agree more.<br>Gregory C.

How can Peter claim that on the day of Pentecost the prophecy of Joel was being fulfilled, with signs in heaven and wonders on earth, the sun turned to darkness and the moon to blood? The language and imagery of biblical prophecy has been the source of puzzlement for many Christians and a point of dispute for some. How ironic that is! For the prophets and seers were the wordsmiths of their time. They took pains to speak God's word clearly and effectively to their contemporaries. How should we, as citizens of the twenty-first century, understand the imagery of this ancient biblical literature? Are there any clues in the texts themselves, any principles we can apply as we read these important but puzzling biblical texts? D. Brent Sandy carefully considers the language and imagery of prophecy and apocalyptic, how it is used, how it is fulfilled within Scripture, and how we should read it against the horizon of our future. Clearly and engagingly written, <em>Plowshares and Pruning Hooks</em> is the kind of book that gives its readers a new vantage point from which to view the landscape of prophetic and apocalyptic language and imagery.</p><p>Sandy (Ph.D., Duke University) teaches New Testament and Greek at Wheaton College. His books include <em>Plowshares and Pruning Hooks: Rethinking the Language of Biblical Prophecy and Apocalyptic.</em>"With every new major turn of events in the Middle East, many Christians scramble for their Bibles and seek to link the prophecies of the past to the events of the present. Brent Sandy has provided for both the average Bible reader and the serious student of Scripture some careful thinking on how to approach these prophetic texts that so intrigue them. Readers will find <em>Plowshares and Pruning Hooks</em> both balanced and challenging. They may not agree on every point, but all of us can appreciate the call for a consistent and careful approach to prophetic texts. This book opens the door for laymen and scholar alike to a serious study of prophetic literature and its value as part of the Word of God." (David R. Plaster, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Grace College and Seminary)<br><br>"Sandy's book reflects insights gained over long years of careful research. His investigation of the use of imagery, metaphor and stylized language in connection with prophetic literature provides a much-needed correction and direction to a field that is too often plagued by speculative excesses. His command of the subject is ably demonstrated by his own use of imagery in presenting his observations and evidence of the data. This is not just another book on prophecy. It is a groundbreaking proposal that invites further scrutiny from readers of all persuasions. Geared for a general audience, laymen, pastors and scholars alike will nonetheless profit from its balanced presentation. It will need to be consulted by any serious reader of the Scriptures." (Richard D. Patterson, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Liberty University)<br><br>"Timely, engaging, probing, carefully researched and faithful to the biblical text, <em>Plowshares and Pruning Hooks</em> will be helpful reading for students, biblical scholars, theologians and pastors alike. Not all questions are answered, but the right questions are raised. While not satisfying all of his readers, Sandy offers considerable guidance for the beginning student and provides fresh insights for the seasoned scholar. This comprehensive exploration of the language of prophecy and apocalyptic will prove to be valuable for many." (David S. Dockery, President, Union University)<br><br>"Luther is reported to have said that the prophets have a 'strange way of talking.' Anyone who has read Isaiah or Daniel closely knows the truth of these words. Brent Sandy helps us to engage the prophets intelligently and avoid sensationalist readings that take us down a road that obscures God's message. I will recommend this book to all my students." (Tremper Longman III, Robert H. Gundry Professor of Old Testament, Westmont College)<br><br>"This book represents the fruition of Sandy's many years of careful study and thinking on the commonly misunderstood topic of prophetic language. I have benefited from his insights over the years and am delighted to see his work finally made available to a wider audience. Students of the Bible who have been baffled by the prophetic texts of Scripture and their many interpretations will find great relief and helpful guidance in this book. Sandy's presentation makes excellent use of illustrations from the English language to guide the reader in understanding the language of prophecy. The resulting explanations enable the reader to bypass popular sensationalism and reclaim the biblical prophecies as God's Word." (John H. Walton, Professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College Graduate School)</p><h2>Stepping into Freedom: An Introduction to Buddhist Monastic Training</h2><p><p>Have you ever wished for a simpler life or an opportunity to transform the stresses of the busyness and complexity of our fast-paced society? <em>Stepping into Freedom</em> offers us a look at Buddhist monastic life and shows us all ways to live simply, beautifully and happily while dwelling in the present moment.

Visit him online at http://www.christopherpenczak.com.</p>In this, his 10th volume on metaphysics, Penczak praises the traditional tools of magick (e.g., altars, candles and special ingredients), but devotes his energies to spells "accessible at any time, through meditation, visualization, words, and intent." Most of the book deals with clearly described procedures that are designed to effect change upon the spell caster more than on the outside world. After providing introductory techniques to alter consciousness, often through breathing, Penczak offers cross-cultural paradigms (the five elements, the web of life, chakras, astrology and the Tree of Life), encouraging readers to build a working familiarity with these tools for harnessing energy to create change. The 28 spells themselves range from the pedestrian (finding a good parking space) to the sublime (animal communication) as well as the ongoing and essential (perseverance). For each he provides corresponding colors, elements, chakras, planets, entities and the like. His clear instructions make this magick within reach of everyone, and his substantive appendix of corresponding systems (stones, animals, deities, etc.) is helpful. Chapters on healing are especially valuable. Penczak contends that in focused states of mind, clarified, applied thoughts are real things that shape us and our world. To this end, we should engage them with wisdom and precision. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Before we can create anything, we have to imagine it. And what we imagine comes from the deepest place inside us. </p><p>Where did we get this amazing ability to picture things our eyes cannot see? To find out, we need to turn to the greatest story of all. There we read that, once upon a time, God imagined our world. And then He made it so. He pictured people like you and me, and He breathed life into us. He wanted to share the joy of making things and seeing that they are good. So He planted a tiny seed of His creativity in our hearts. </p><p>Every time someone tells a story, imagination is at work. Without leaving our chairs, we travel through time and space. And when we enter the enchanted Kingdom called Faerie- whether or not we find any faeries-we see the world in brand-new ways. Old, everyday things like wardrobes and mirrors and wells take us where we have never been. We never know what to expect around each corner and turn in the road. </p><p>Between the covers of this book are many gateways to magical places. Go where you like and leave when you want to. Take the doors you choose in any order you wish. </p><p>But whenever you venture into Faerie, remember that the world of imagination is a dangerous place filled with giants and ogres and dragons, as well as magic wishes and thrilling adventures. Here is how J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings, describes it : "The land of fairy-story is wide and deep and high, and is filled with many things: all manner of beasts and birds are found there: shoreless seas and stars uncounted; beauty that is enchantment, and an ever-present peril; both sorrow and joy as sharp as swords." </p><p>"To make it safely through the lands of enchantment," writes coeditor Kathryn Lindskoog, "you will need </p><p>� A light to guide your path, � A sword to battle evil, and � A shield to guard your heart. </p><p>All three of these gifts can be yours from the same One who gave you the golden key of imagination. Use them wisely as you explore the kingdom of the fairies.</p></p><h2>National Geographic Kids Cookbook: A Year-Round Fun Food Adventure</h2><p>Join Barton Seaver&#x2014;master chef and National Geographic Explorer&#x2014;on a year-round culinary adventure as he explores what it takes to create the ultimate dish.

In this book, she recounts her difficult childhood as the daughter of an army sergeant, her love affair at age fifteen with an older man, the legacy of alcoholism, the troubled history of her adopted daughters, and her own physical struggles since a recent horse accident. She shows how historic and emotional pain are passed down through generations, blending personal history with stories of important Indian figures of the past such as Lozen, the woman who was the military strategist for Geronimo, and Ohiesha, the Santee Sioux medical doctor who witnessed the massacre at Wounded Knee. Ultimately, Hogan sees herself and her people whole again and gives an illuminating story of personal triumph. "This wise and compassionate offering deserves to be widely read."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, starred review</p><p>Linda Hogan was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her novel Mean Spirit. Her other honors include an American Book Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She lives in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.In a Cree Indian story, Wolverine convinced the animals of the world to keep their eyes closed, so humans wouldn't see their "inner fire" and try to steal it. People, too, can close their eyes and protect their inner fires even if it means those fires may burn them, observes Hogan (Mean Spirit), an award-winning Chickasaw novelist and poet. She herself was seared by such bottled-up fire throughout her girlhood. Raised by an alcoholic, army sergeant father and a pathologically silent mother, she turned first, at age 12, to a steady older lover, then to alcohol. Her adult life, too, has been a series of struggles adopting two seriously disturbed children, enduring amnesia following a head injury and coping with her fibromyalgia but she has learned from each experience to find beauty and grace even in darkness. Hogan's memories spill out in waves of layered associations: from fire to pain, from "phantom pain" to "phantom worlds," from glaciers to dreams. Into her personal history, she integrates stories from the American Indian past. In Hogan's writing, the smallest detail can evoke a whole history: that Chief Joseph's skull was sold to be used as an ashtray sums up the tragic mistreatment of American Indians at the hands of whites. Wiping out so much Native wisdom has left our world diminished, defoliated in "landscape and spirit," in Hogan's eyes. Still, Native culture is beginning to thrive again, reminding us that just as every "before" has an "after," "beginnings" have "returns." Life, Hogan concludes, "may never be easy but may be beautiful," even in this "broken world." This wise and compassionate offering deserves to be widely reviewed and read. Agent, Beth Vesel, Sanford J. Greenberger Associates. (June)Forecast: Deep and full of grace, Hogan's writing is every bit as good as ever. Anyone who knows anything about Native American writing will rush to buy it.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Playing Dead: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;A compelling family mystery that kept me turning the pages.

Four months out of the year, it&#x2019;s too damn hot to think. <br><br>It is a good place to get lost. That&#x2019;s what my mother did thirty-two years ago. The fact that she successfully hid this from almost everyone who loved her makes her a pretty good liar. I&#x2019;m not sure what it says about me. <br><br>When I was a little girl, my grandmother would tell my fortune to keep me still. I vividly remember one August day when the red line on the back porch thermometer crept up to 108. Sweat dribbled down the backs of my knees, a thin cotton sundress pressed wet against my back. My legs swung back and forth under the kitchen table, too short to reach the floor. Granny snapped beans in a soothing rhythm. I stared at a tall glass pitcher of icedtea that floated with mint leaves and quarter moons of lemon, wishing I could jump in. Granny promised a storm coming from Oklahoma would cool things off by dinner. The fan kept blowing the cards off the table and I kept slapping them down, giggling. <br><br>The fortune is long forgotten, but I can still hear the anguished joy of my mother playing a Bach concerto in the background. <br><br>Two years later, on the worst day of my life, what I remember most is being cold. Granny and I stood in a darkened funeral parlor, the window air conditioner blowing up goose bumps on my arms. Cracks of September sunlight tried to push in around the shades. It was at least ninety degrees outside, but I wanted my winter coat. I wanted to lie down and never wake up. Granny gripped my hand tighter, as if she could hear my thoughts. Merle Haggard blared from a passing pickup truck and faded away. I could hear my mother crying from another room. <br><br>That&#x2019;s how I remember Mama&#x2014;present but absent. <br><br>I&#x2019;m not like that. People know when I&#x2019;m around. <br><br>I&#x2019;ve been told that I have a strange name for a girl, that I&#x2019;m nosy, that I&#x2019;m too delicate to carry a gun. The first two are true. <br><br>I&#x2019;ve been told that it&#x2019;s weird to love both Johnny Cash and Vivaldi, that I&#x2019;m way too white for a Texan and too skinny for a fast food junkie, that my hair is long and straight enough to hang a cat, that I look more like a New York City ballet dancer than a former champion roper. (In Texas, New York City is never a complimentary adjective.) <br><br>I&#x2019;ve been told that my sister, Sadie, and I shouldn&#x2019;t have beaten up Jimmy Walker in fifth grade because he is still whining about it to a therapist. <br><br>I&#x2019;ve been told that growing up in Ponder must have been an idyllic childhood, picket fence and all. I tell those people I&#x2019;m more familiar with barbed wire and have the scars on my belly to prove it. <br><br>I learned early that nothing is what it seems. The nice butcher at the Piggly Wiggly who saved bones for our dogs beat his wife. The homecoming queen&#x2019;s little sister was really the daughter she had in seventh grade. That&#x2019;s the way life was. <br><br>In a place like Ponder, everyone knew your secrets. Atleast, that&#x2019;s what I thought before. I never pictured my mother, the legendary pianist of the First Baptist Church of Ponder, as a woman with something to hide. I never dreamed that opening a stranger&#x2019;s letter would be pulling a loose thread that would unravel everything. That, one day, I&#x2019;d scrutinize every memory for the truth. <br><br>The letter is five days old and I have read it forty-two times. It is pink and smells like the perfume of a woman I don&#x2019;t know. It arrived on a Wednesday, right to Daddy&#x2019;s office, sandwiched between a plea from Doctors Without Borders and a brochure on a new exhibit at the Amon Carter Museum. <br><br>Daddy&#x2019;s secretary, Melva, a former teacher and widow on the upside of her sixties, picked the envelope out of the stack as something I needed to see. Personal, she said. Not spit out by a computer. A sympathy card, perhaps, because that was one of the few things people still felt obligated to write by hand. <br><br>When I opened it and read the careful feminine scrawl, I felt the earth shift. The tremor started low, in my toes, and worked its way up, although I can&#x2019;t say why the letter had such an instant effect on me. <br><br>The odds were that the woman who wrote this was a scam artist. Or simply had the wrong girl. The wrong Tommie McCloud, spelled with an ie. <br><br>Each of the forty-two times I read the letter, I wanted to hop in my pickup and go home to Mama, even though Mama isn&#x2019;t there and home is now an empty ranch house with faded flowered sheets covering the furniture like an indoor meadow. <br><br>But home is also endless rolling land, shimmering heat, sweet memories that thrum in the air with the cicadas. Home pulls at me like a magnet. Even when my body is hundreds of miles away, my soul stays behind, clinging to the live oak by the cement pond where I learned to dog paddle. <br><br>They say that Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s shoulders rolled back and he relaxed as soon as he could see his ranchland stretching out below Air Force One. My Granny called LBJ an egotistical lunatic, but that profound connection he had with a patch of earth makes him OK in my book. I&#x2019;ve tried to leave for good, to beat a new path, but I have been safest and happiest on Elizabeth Ranch, where my great-great-grandfather was born, where I grew up. <br><br>Less kind people would say I never grew up. They call mea runaway. <br><br>If anyone asked, I would describe myself as temporarily off-course ever since eight hundred pounds of steer stomped on my wrist fourteen years ago in a rodeo arena in Lubbock, Texas, knocking me from the pedestal of my saddle into mortality. It took two seconds for Black Diablo to crush both twelve bones in my forearm and wrist and any wispy thoughts in my mother&#x2019;s head of tearing me away from the rodeo and turning me into a concert pianist. My fingers never worked the same again. <br><br>Goodbye to getting a master&#x2019;s at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music. Goodbye to my collegiate rodeo competitions, because a year of physical therapy later, I couldn&#x2019;t swing a rope. I had the yips, like acatcher who suddenly can&#x2019;t throw a ball straight back to the mound after doing it thousands of times. <br><br>What else did I know besides Bach and rodeo? When the shattered bones healed, I left home, raw and angry, not sure whose dreams I&#x2019;d been living. I spent a year in Europe as a backpacking, hostel-living clich�. Four years at the University of Texas getting a degree in child psychology, three more working toward my Ph.D. at Rice. Five years in Wyoming at Halo Ranch, a nonprofit that uses horses to coax sick and emotionally distraught t kids back to life, lured there by an internship and an irresistible fellow Ph.D. candidate. Somewhere in there, I fell out of infatuation with him and back in love with horses. <br><br>Then, two weeks ago, Daddy died, and I came home to Ponder for good. I hadn&#x2019;t said it out loud, but I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t leave again. <br><br>My eyes close for a second and I can picture every word on the perfumed pink page in front of me, the spidery scrawl that is setting everything in motion. <br><br>Dear Tommie, it begins. Have you ever wondered about who you are? <br><br>Always, I tell myself. Always. But not in the way you think. <br><br>I&#x2019;m looking for my daughter who was kidnapped July 15,1981, when she was only one. <br><br>I do the simple math one more time. She was kidnapped thirty-one years ago and I am 32 years old. <br><br>Her name is Adriana Marchetti. <br><br>She&#x2019;s Italian, I think. I am pale. I freckle in the sun. My hair is untouched blond. <br><br>I&#x2019;ve spent most of my life searching for you. I believe you are my daughter. <br><br>I want to shout at this invisible woman. My mother never lies. Never. It was the one thing that disappointed her the most, if her girls lied to her. And my father? Even less likely. <br><br>But I cannot lie to myself now. There was another letter to consider. This one had shown up at the ranch in Wyoming. An official one, with my name, Tommie Anne McCloud, behind the envelope&#x2019;s waxy window. <br><br>The envelope contained a Social Security card with a brand-new number and a letter informing me that an extensive internal review of the past fifty years of Social Security numbers unearthed hundreds of clerking errors. The first three digits of my number did not reflect where my birth certificate said I was born. <br><br>Take this number instead. <br><br>No big deal. To them. But that number had been a part of me all my life. I was attached to it, like I was to my hair, my childhood cat Clyde, and the date of my birth. It was one of the few numbers I could spit out automatically, packed in my brain with all of the other passwords and security codes required for membership in the twenty-first century. It had been a nightmare to change it on my passport, insurance cards, credit cards. <br><br>But I&#x2019;d never called to ask any questions. Why would I? <br><br>That letter was somewhere in a landfill by now. Daddy&#x2019;s Mac in front of me glowed, encouraging. I typed &#x201c;Social Security Administration&#x201d; into Google, found an 800 number, punched it into my cell, and spent ten minutes bouncing around telephone menus that had no options for grieving, emotionally distraught daughters possibly kidnapped more than thirty years ago. I yelled &#x201c;Representative&#x201d; into the phone until the fake voice gave up and transferred me to a live woman, who introduced herself as Crystal. <br><br>&#x201c;I got a Social Security card with a new number in the mail a couple of years ago,&#x201d; I told Crystal. &#x201c;My name is Tommie McCloud.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh. Hundreds of people did. Is there a problem?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I just wondered...why? Where did the first three digits indicate I was born?&#x201d; As I asked this, it occurred to me that I probably could have Googled this kind of information and saved a lot of time. <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just asking now? Never mind. Give me the first three digits of the old number and the new number.&#x201d; I recited them obediently and she came back on the line a few seconds later. She had probably Googled it. <br><br>&#x201c;Chicago, Illinois.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was born at a hospital in Fort Worth.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Her tone was overly patient. &#x201c;That is why you got a new card.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;This has been a huge hassle,&#x201d; I said, irritated with her patronizing air, wanting to be distracted from the reason I called her in the first place. <br><br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, do you have any issues I can specifically help you with now? This is in response to our nation&#x2019;s heightened vulnerability to security threats and identity fraud. Do you not want a safe nation?&#x201d; <br><br>Ah, the twenty-first-century tactic: Switch the blame right back to the consumer. Yesterday, a representative for the phone company told me it would take a month to set up phone and internet service at the Ponder ranch. When I sputtered a protest, he asked whether I really thought I deserved to be put ahead of other consumers in line. And was I not aware of Texas flooding? I couldn&#x2019;t dignify that with an answer. The black earth in Daddy&#x2019;s fields was cracking from the heat. I pictured the phone rep shutting his eyes and stabbing his finger pin-the-tail-on-the donkey style at a list titled Natural disasters: Excuses they might fall for. <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re attacking my patriotism?&#x201d; I asked Crystal, thinking that wasn&#x2019;t her real name or accent, that her own dry, un-American ass was probably sitting in India. &#x201c;Are you reading from a script? Because I&#x2019;d recommend you get a new script.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to put you down as a customer hang-up,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br><br>Silence on the other end. Crystal was gone. <br><br>It didn&#x2019;t matter. I couldn&#x2019;t avoid it any longer. <br><br>Rosalina Marchetti&#x2019;s letter was clear on this fact. Her daughter, Adriana, had been kidnapped in Chicago, Illinois. Rosalina wanted me to travel there sometime in the next few weeks, all on her dime. <br><br>Did she know that my father had just died? Wasn&#x2019;t that how these scammers worked, with a cold eye on the obituaries, one of the few places where unusual names are usually spelled correctly? Because that&#x2019;s the thing: Rarely did anyone spell my name right who wasn&#x2019;t a blood relation, and half of them didn&#x2019;t, either. <br><br>I read the letter for the forty-third time and it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m twelve years old again sitting in the corner of a horse stall with a flashlight and a terrifying book, frantic to warn the heroine of terrible peril but secretly knowing I can protect her for a day, for months, for years, forever, by simply slamming the book shut. Ending her story in the middle. <br><br>I stare at Rosalina Marchetti&#x2019;s signature. It sweeps arrogantly across the right bottom half of the page, tall and loopy. Under her name, like an afterthought, she had scribbled: <br><br>And the angels cried.</p><h2>Sophie&#39;s Masterpiece: Sophie&#39;s Masterpiece</h2><p>Sophie's no ordinary house spider. She's an artist; and every web she spins is more wondrous than the one before. But don't mention that to the guests at Beekman's Boardinghouse, because they don't like spiders. No one there wants anything to do with Sophie or her magnificent creations -- no one except the woman on the third floor. She's a new mother "weaving" something herself; and when she runs out of yarn, Sophie knows the time has finally come to create the masterpiece of a lifetime. <br> Eileen Spinelli and Jane Dyer, the award-winning duo who created the best-selling <i>When Mama Comes Home Tonight,</i> team up once again to tell the charming and bittersweet tale of an exceptionally gifted spider and the lengths she's willing to go to share her gifts with those around her.</p><p>Sophie is an artist. She is also a house spider, but one that children will certainly cheer and not fear. The webs she weaves are spectacular--some are stars, or hammocks, or sun patterns--and her mama is very proud of her. When she grows old enough to strike out on her own, however, she is not warmly greeted by the world at large. At Beekman's Boardinghouse, a dull sort of place that "cried out for her talents," she only wants to beautify it with her gossamer artistry. But even as she is spinning a web of curtains for the front parlor, "blending a golden thread of sun into her silk," she is swatted by a screaming landlady! She scampers into the tugboat captain's closet where she sets to work on making him a new suit, day after day, a sleeve here, a collar there. Once discovered there (the captain screeches and climbs out onto the windowsill), she moves on yet again. Now a much older spider, she climbs up a long staircase to settle into a young woman's knitting basket. One day, the woman discovers Sophie... and smiles! Sophie, noticing that her new friend is pregnant and in need of a baby blanket, decides that she will spin one for her baby, a cloth into which she weaves starlight, snippets of fragrant pine, wisps of night, old lullabies, playful snowflakes, and, in the end, her very own heart. Illustrator Jane Dyer, who worked with Eileen Spinelli on <i>When Mama Comes Home Tonight</i>, has outdone herself in <i>Sophie's Masterpiece</i>, painting this bittersweet story in gentle watercolors. She manages to convincingly anthropomorphize Sophie, and paintings like the one of the courageous spider struggling up the long staircase, casting long shadows, will linger long with readers.

She sifts through myth and hyperbole: misrepresentations about danger, about the type of people who ride and why they do so. <em>The Perfect Vehicle</em> is not a mere recitation of facts, nor is it a polemic or apologia. Its vivid historical accounts-the beginnings of the machine, the often hidden tradition of women who ride, the tale of the defiant ones who taunt death on the racetrack-are intertwined with Pierson's own story, which, in itself, shows that although you may think you know what kind of person rides a motorcycle, you probably don't.</p><p>"From my mother I learned to write prompt thank-you notes for a variety of occasions," Melissa Holbrook Pierson writes. "From Mrs. King's ballroom dancing school I learned a proper curtsy and, believe it or not, what to do if presented with nine eating utensils at the same place setting.... From motorcycles I learned practically everything else." Pierson, an intellectual New Yorker, is open to her own contradictions--she is bold and fearful, a motorcycle-crazed poet with a Ph.D., and these seeming incompatibilities are what make this book so good. She can write equally well about the visceral pleasures of riding and about the pains of heartbreak or her own displeasure with her fears.<p> This is the motorcycle memoir for those who are sick of memoirs--or motorcycles. It is a book for people who don't know what the big deal is about riding, or why the Guggenheim Museum in New York, in a swirl of controversy, would exhibit motorcycles as works of modern art. "Riding on a motorcycle can make you feel joyous, powerful, peaceful, frightened, vulnerable, and back out to happy again," Pierson writes, "perhaps in the same ten miles. It is life compressed, its own answer to the question, 'Why?'" <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Melissa Holbrook Pierson is the author of The Perfect Vehicle, The Place You Love Is Gone, Dark Horses and Black Beauties, and The Man Who Would Stop at Nothing and The Secret History of Kindness.

Narrated by a doctor who returns to his old neighborhood for the first time in nearly forty years to attend the funeral of his boyhood parish priest, the story blends hilarious accounts of childhood escapades with the timelessly poignant theme of loss. Reminiscences resonate as the story unfolds, evoking laughter in one moment and tugging on heartstrings the next. Whether you attended Catholic school or merely know someone who did, there is a lot of all of us in the story of Father Tim.</p><p>Tom Robertson was born in Joliet, Illinois and attended Catholic schools for eight years, where he first learned to negotiate, on more than a few occasions reducing his sentence to time served for various venial sins and classroom transgressions. He graduated from the University of Illinois, where he played varsity baseball, and holds a Master's Degree in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. Tom lives in Frankfort, Illinois with his wife Sandy and their daughters, Katie &amp; Kelsey.</p><h2>Jews Without Money: A Novel</h2><p><p> As a writer and political activist in early-twentieth-century America, Michael Gold was an important presence on the American cultural scene for more than three decades. Beginning in the 1920s his was a powerful journalistic voice for social change and human rights, and <i>Jews Without Money</i>--the author's only novel--is a passionate record of the times. First published in 1930, this fictionalized autobiography offered an unusually candid look at the thieves, gangsters, and ordinary citizens who struggled against brutal odds in lower East Side Manhattan. Like Henry Roth's <i>Call It Sleep</i> and Abraham Cahan's <i>The Rise and Fall of David Levinsky</i>, <i>Jews Without Money</i> is a literary landmark of the Jewish experience.<br><br> Michael Gold (1893&#x2013;1967) was born in New York City, where later he wrote for radical journals and newspapers such as New Masses and The Liberator. <i>Jews Without Money</i> has been translated in more than fourteen countries, including Germany, where the novel was employed against Nazi propaganda.</p></p><p>Michael Gold (1893&#x2013;1967) was born in New York City, where later he wrote for radical journals and newspapers such as New Masses and The Liberator.

That sets it apart from other legal writing textbooks, which mainly organize around parts of an appellate brief. Organized to reflect the client-advocacy process that results in written documents, the text begins with meeting the client, moves to investigating the facts, and then provides guidance on analyzing and choosing the appropriate persuasive strategy. The material is rooted in concepts of narrative theory, brain science, and cognitive psychology. The book is written in an easy-to-read, conversational style to guide students through an explanation that classical rhetoric and modern persuasion theory provide the foundation for memorable legal writing. Coverage includes both the trial and appellate levels. By focusing on the process of persuasion, <em><strong>Your Client s Story: Persuasive Legal Writing </strong></em>creates strong connections between the first-year objectives and the upper-level skills, externship, and clinic courses. Editable versions of the sample briefs appear in the appendices so that professors can tailor them to individual needs.</p> <p><strong>New to the Second Edition: </strong></p> <ul> <li>A new chapter on logical fallacies, unique among legal coursebooks, categorizing and describing 16 common logical fallacies, providing examples and guidance on how to spot and avoid them</li> <li>A new chapter on reasoning with facts (inferential reasoning), covering fact synthesis, weight of facts, and drawing negative inferences from the absence of critical facts</li> <li>Expanded coverage of how to write a powerful conclusion to your brief</li> </ul> <p><strong>Professors and students will benefit from:</strong></p> <ul> <li>This book focuses on the question, How can the lawyer persuade the audience through legal writing? rather than What does a brief look like? </li> <li>This book puts the facts first. It is the only text on the market to devote several chapters to factual research, fact synthesis, and reasoning with facts.</li> <li>The client-centered focus makes this textbook unique in the legal writing market. By learning how to effectively tell Your Client s Story, this book helps students stay grounded in client-based advocacy.</li> <li>The book includes more extensive coverage of visual design than competing books, including a discussion of visualized legal reasoning.</li> <li>The authors have individually and collective written germinal legal scholarship about legal narrative and legal document design. The authors are all prior presidents of the Legal Writing Institute.

This book provides an in-depth exploration into the aesthetics of what makes a great mix. Gibson&#x2019;s unique approach explains how to map sounds to visuals in order to create a visual framework that can be used to analyze what is going on in any mix. </p> <p>Once you have the framework down, Gibson then uses it to explain the traditions that have be developed over time by great recording engineers for different styles of music and songs. You will come to understand everything that can be done in a mix to create dynamics that affect people in really deep ways. </p> <p>Once you understand what engineers are doing to create the great mixes they do, you can then use this framework to develop your own values as to what you feel is a good mix. Once you have a perspective on what all can be done, you have the power to be truly creative on your own &#x2013; to create whole new mixing possibilities. </p> <p>It is all about creating art out of technology. This book goes beyond explaining what the equipment does &#x2013; it explains what to do with the equipment to make the best possible mixes.</p></p><p><p>David Gibson has been teaching, engineering and producing groups in major 24 track studios since 1982 and is the founder of Globe Institute of Recording and Production which offer classes in San Francisco and online.

Explanations are concise and mathematical prerequisites have been kept to a minimum.<br>In the first four chapters, the author presents the vocabulary of crystallography, with discussions of lattice points, unit cells, symmetry, point groups, crystal systems, space groups, and equivalent positions. The principles of x-ray diffraction and methods of determining crystal structures are summarized in the next two chapters. The final chapter describes various simple structures. Appendixes list the 230 space groups, introduce the reciprocal lattice, and describe the powder method. A well-chosen selection of problems (with solutions) encourages self-study.<br>Ideal as the basis for a course in crystallography and highly useful as an adjunct to physical chemistry courses, this book will also serve as an excellent reference for practicing chemists, mineralogists, metallurgists, and other workers in the field. 1969 edition.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Mad at School: Rhetorics of Mental Disability and Academic Life (Corporealities: Discourses Of Disability)</h2><p><p>"A very important study that will appeal to a disability studies audience as well as scholars in social movements, social justice, critical pedagogy, literacy education, professional development for disability and learning specialists in access centers and student counseling centers, as well as the broader domains of sociology and education."<br> ---Melanie Panitch, Ryerson University</p> <p>"Ableism is alive and well in higher education. We do not know how to abandon the myth of the 'pure (ivory) tower that props up and is propped up by ableist ideology.' . . . <i>Mad at School</i> is thoroughly researched and pathbreaking. . . . The author's presentation of her own experience with mental illness is woven throughout the text with candor and eloquence."<br> ---Linda Ware, State University of New York at Geneseo</p> <p><i>Mad at School</i> explores the contested boundaries between disability, illness, and mental illness in the setting of U.S. higher education. Much of the research and teaching within disability studies assumes a disabled body but a rational and energetic (an "agile") mind. In <i>Mad at School</i>, scholar and disabilities activist Margaret Price asks: How might our education practices change if we understood disability to incorporate the disabled mind?</p> <p>Mental disability (more often called "mental illness") is a topic of fast-growing interest in all spheres of American culture, including popular, governmental, aesthetic, and academic. <i>Mad at School</i> is a close study of the ways that mental disabilities impact academic culture. Investigating spaces including classrooms, faculty meeting rooms, and job searches, Price challenges her readers to reconsider long-held values of academic life, including productivity, participation, security, and independence. Ultimately, she argues that academic discourse both produces and is produced by a tacitly privileged "able mind," and that U.S. higher education would benefit from practices that create a more accessible academic world.</p> <p><i>Mad at School</i> is the first book to use a disability-studies perspective to focus on the ways that mental disabilities impact academic culture at institutions of higher education. Individual chapters examine the language used to denote mental disability; the role of "participation" and "presence" in student learning; the role of "collegiality" in faculty work; the controversy over "security" and free speech that has arisen in the wake of recent school shootings; and the marginalized status of independent scholars with mental disabilities.</p> <p>Margaret Price is Associate Professor of English at Spelman College.</p></p><p>Margaret Price is Associate Professor of English at Spelman College.</p><h2>Creation and Anarchy: The Work of Art and the Religion of Capitalism (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)</h2><p>Creation and the giving of orders are closely entwined in Western culture, where God commands the world into existence and later issues the injunctions known as the Ten Commandments. The <i>arche</i>, or origin, is always also a command, and a beginning is always the first principle that governs and decrees. This is as true for theology, where God not only creates the world but governs and continues to govern through continuous creation, as it is for the philosophical and political tradition according to which beginning and creation, command and will, together form a strategic apparatus without which our society would fall apart. The five essays collected here aim to deactivate this apparatus through a patient archaeological inquiry into the concepts of work, creation, and command. Giorgio Agamben explores every nuance of the <i>arche</i> in search of an <i>an-archic</i> exit strategy. By the book's final chapter, anarchy appears as the secret center of power, brought to light so as to make possible a philosophical thought that might overthrow both the principle and its command.</p><p><b>Giorgio Agamben</b> is a contemporary Italian philosopher and political theorist whose works have been translated into numerous languages.

In just a few weeks she&#x2019;ll have the operation that will turn her from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty. And as a pretty, she&#x2019;ll be catapulted into a high-tech paradise where her only job is to have fun.<br> <br>But Tally&#x2019;s new friend Shay isn&#x2019;t sure she wants to become a pretty. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world&#x2014;and it isn&#x2019;t very pretty. The authorities offer Tally a choice: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. Tally&#x2019;s choice will change her world forever.</p><p>Playing on every teen&#x2019;s passionate desire to look as good as everybody else, Scott Westerfeld (<i>Midnighters</i>) projects a future world in which a compulsory operation at sixteen wipes out physical differences and makes everyone pretty by conforming to an ideal standard of beauty. The "New Pretties" are then free to play and party, while the younger "Uglies" look on enviously and spend the time before their own transformations in plotting mischievous tricks against their elders. Tally Youngblood is one of the most daring of the Uglies, and her imaginative tricks have gotten her in trouble with the menacing department of Special Circumstances. She has yearned to be pretty, but since her best friend Shay ran away to the rumored rebel settlement of recalcitrant Uglies called The Smoke, Tally has been troubled. The authorities give her an impossible choice: either she follows Shay&#x2019;s cryptic directions to The Smoke with the purpose of betraying the rebels, or she will never be allowed to become pretty. Hoping to rescue Shay, Tally sets off on the dangerous journey as a spy. But after finally reaching The Smoke she has a change of heart when her new lover David reveals to her the sinister secret behind becoming pretty. The fast-moving story is enlivened by many action sequences in the style of videogames, using intriguing inventions like hoverboards that use the rider&#x2019;s skateboard skills to skim through the air, and bungee jackets that make wild downward plunges survivable -- and fun. Behind all the commotion is the disturbing vision of our own society -- the Rusties -- visible only in rusting ruins after a virus destroyed all petroleum. Teens will be entranced, and the cliffhanger ending will leave them gasping for the sequel.

He provides a vivid picture of the bureaucratic infighting, political prerogatives, and Congressional courtesies necessary to make something happen on Capitol Hill. In a Postscript to the 2000 edition, Redman reflects on how that process has, and has not, changed in the thirty years since the book was first published.</p><p><p>A classic description of the legislative process, tracing the drafting and passing of a single piece of legislation with all the maneuvering, frustrations, and triumphs involved.</p>The Dance of Legislation is a classic description of the American legislative process.

She was a tireless member of the antiwar movement, the civil rights movement, the tenants&#x2019; rights movement, the anti-nuclear-power movement, and the Women&#x2019;s Pentagon Action, among other causes, and proved herself to be a passionate citizen of each of her communities&#x2015;New York City and rural Vermont.</p></p><p>Grace Paley, born in the Bronx in 1922, was a renowned writer and activist.

You can take the <i>Reader</i> to a rally and feel galvanized by Paley's conviction, or you can take it to bed late at night and find pleasure and comfort in humane prose." &#x2015;Alexandra Schwartz, <i>New Yorker</i> </p><p>"This new collection reminds us that Paley, despite her view of herself as writer/housewife, was not so much a writer who drifted onto political subjects from time to time; she was a full-time activist and moral leader who happened to be gifted at writing . . . Among the many pleasures of Paley&#x2019;s work is the reassurance it offers that, just as we survived the events of those years, by analogy, we may yet survive the things that menace us now . . . It&#x2019;s hard to think of another writer who has been admired for her virtuous, cheerful, and positive character as much as for her work." &#x2015;Diane Johnson, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><p>"If the <i>Reader </i>was intended as a memorial, published a decade after her death, it now seems more pressing&#x2015;a necessary antidote to the current demoralization of the American left and the disorientation of what remains of the country&#x2019;s center. . . Of the voices of mid-century American radicalism, few could ever make perseverance seem so vital.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nicholas Dames, <i>The Atlantic</i></p><p>"Grace Paley may be the most underrated of New York twentieth-century writers . . . Paley became a knower of women, a conscious feminist, and a writer all at once . . . There are many generous writers, and many who cared more for living and writing and their families than they cared for fame. But of all these Grace Paley is one of the very best, which <i>A Grace Paley Reader </i>knows." &#x2015;Joseph Livingstone, <i>New Republic</i></p><p>"[<i>A Grace Paley Reader</i>] reminds us that Paley the short-story writer was also Paley the activist, the pamphleteer, the poet, the community organizer, and the committed leftist . . . <i>A Grace Paley Reader</i> helps to return the writer to her historical moment, to the specific conditions that shaped her life as an artist and activist . . . Her fiction was more than just empathetic: It not only sought to understand the world from the point of view of others, but also insisted on how integral this sense of connection was to the work of radical politics." &#x2015;Maggie Doherty, <i>The Nation</i></p><p>"[<i>A Grace Paley Reader </i>is] the kind of retrospective that, in an era in which plot has given way to character, reveals the vital scope of [Paley's] influence.&#x201d; &#x2015;Megan O'Grady, <i>Vogue</i> (Must-Read Books of Spring 2017)</p><p>"The new <i>A Grace Paley Reader, </i>edited by Kevin Bowen and Nora Paley and introduced by George Saunders, makes accessible the writings of a woman who lived a life of tenacious and peaceful resistance. Divided into three sections, Paley&#x2019;s stories, essays, and poems convey distilled wisdom gained from a lifetime of fighting for what she believed . . . her voice is an especially important one now.

And the longer I&#x2019;ve had it with me, the more I find myself identifying with a title that had at first seemed awfully studious.

As with all good writing, these stories are timeless . . . After encountering one of Paley&#x2019;s stories, it is hard to leave it behind. It&#x2015;and the characters who fill it&#x2015;linger. In his introduction to this volume, author George Saunders calls Paley &#x2018;a kind of secular saint&#x2019;&#x2015;a saint of seeing. It is, indeed, her singular way of seeing that makes Paley&#x2019;s work still relevant, still essential and still so eminently readable.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robert Weibezahl, <i>BookPage</i></p><p>"Paley was the real deal . . . [this] new collection . . . brings together work from the course of her career and provides a much-needed reminder of its importance . . . Her work remains indelible." &#x2015;Paul Wilner, <i>The Millions</i></p><p>"Grace Paley is the most intelligent, generous, incorruptible writer I ever knew. Her daughter says, &#x201c;I learned from her that precision requires a warm eye, not a cold one,&#x201d; and so did we all. Keen wit and real modesty seldom occur in such happy alliance. Who she was is what she writes. She never shows off, never bullies. She asks us what do you think about this? and is interested in our answer. She takes nothing for granted and everything as worth rethinking. Her writing on social issues remains timely because it was never superficial; she held understanding more useful than judgment. Very few writers can match the offhand voice, with its unmistakable oral cadence, in which her poignant, funny short stories are told. Her poem &#x201c;Responsibility&#x201d; set the standard she herself met, and her poetry, always at the service of moral issues, is still giving readers lines to live by. This excellent anthology of her work is a gift of her generous spirit to the rest of this century. I hope it finds the love, warmth, and honor it offers us all." &#x2015; Ursula K. Le Guin</p><p>&#x201c;Grace Paley&#x2019;s work has a way of surprising us in times of reckoning. There&#x2019;s no other voice of calm, deliberate certainty as hers. She possesses the capacity of observation alive with a resolve raised out of the Bronx. This &#x2018;once in a lifetime&#x2019; realist has endured, but, most of all, we need Grace now. <i>A Grace Paley Reader</i> is the best we can do in these times. Whether writing from behind the bars of a Greenwich Village jail where she spent six days for protesting; or deciphering the complexity of love, race and class, motherhood, fidelity, and capitalism; or reporting from North Vietnam, Paley reminds us of a larger responsibility through a personal vernacular that resonates out to the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Yusef Komunyakaa</p><p>&#x201c;Has there ever been an author like Paley? A poet and essayist but primarily a short story writer, she functioned, before her death in 2007 at age 84, as a kind of conscience to the culture, an activist who saw art-making as political from the start . . . her short stories are among the finest produced by an American . . .

This focus explains the &#x201c;why&#x201d; of musical construction more clearly than the traditional approach of beginning with chords. By starting with a single melodic line and gradually adding voices in counterpoint, the book drills part-writing while simultaneously explaining functionality, first with scale degrees and then with harmony. The text has students learn musical techniques and progressively build on their functions and importance to create their own compositions. <br><br>With short, digestible chapters, Music Theory and Composition clearly presents otherwise complicated ideas not as strict rules, but as artistic ideals, encouraging the interactive creation of new compositions as a tool for learning. <br><br>The textbook is versatile and easily customizable, suiting<br><br><ul><ul><li>Different skill levels with species counterpoint providing a framework for the beginner while providing an interesting challenge for more experienced students</li><li>Different curricular schedules with complete exercises in two, three, and four voices, allowing for an optional skip from two voices to four</li><li>Different pedagogical approaches with species exercises encouraging students to consider harmonic choices and figured bass ensuring functional progressions</li></ul></ul><br>Instructor Resources:<br><br><ul><li>Instructor&#x2019;s Manual: The Instructor&#x2019;s Manual includes sample syllabi and student handouts</li><li>Test Bank: The test bank includes sample tests and answer keys in MS Word format.</li></ul><br>Student Resources: <br><br><ul><li>Companion Website with Downloadable Workbook Sections: http://textbooks.rowman.com/stone</li></ul><br>Additional Features:<br><br><ul><li>complete curriculum for first-year theory courses</li><li>over 500 musical examples drawn from Common Practice Era compositions as well as more contemporary and popular pieces</li><li>focus on active composition throughout the text and workbook sections</li><li>large pop music section to expand student&#x2019;s application of theory</li><li>conversational tone to encourage student engagement</li></ul><br>Designed for first-year college music theory courses, but accessible enough for the interested lay reader or high school student, the text offers a true balance of counterpoint and harmony.</p><p>STEPHEN C. STONE has been on the music theory faculty at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University for fourteen years and is the former director of the music program at the Johns Hopkins School of Arts and Sciences.The book is the result of over ten years; work; and it shows. Stone's writing style is "familiar" as if spoken, without being "chummy" or falsely fashionable. The book lacks gimmicks and silly asides to get the reader to "like" the author completely. It's authoritative without being "magisterial"; which really means that is covers its material as approachably as it does comprehensively. If you're looking for a single volume book that already seems to know why you have acquired it and how attached you are to music; yet not unable to admit that you can always learn more about the way good music works, then Music Theory and Composition can be heartily recommended. (<i>Classical Net</i>)<br><br>Stephen Stone&#x2019;s Music Theory and Composition is indeed a practical approach, as the subtitle promises. Giving substantial, readable instruction in rudiments, counterpoint, harmony, and popular music, this flexible text will find immediate use in many different programs and courses. (Mark Lackey, assistant professor, Division of Music, Samford University)<br><br>Stephen Stone&#x2019;s Music Theory and Composition: A Practical Approach provides readers with an exceptionally clear and logical approach to studying music theory. An all-encompassing textbook, it lays out its contents in a fashion that reflects historical progression of music &#x2013; from the study of single melody to species counterpoint, diatonic harmony, forms, and chromatic harmony to popular music. Embedded within this logical flow of the content is the author&#x2019;s ability to explain the &#x2018;why&#x2019;s&#x2019; and &#x2018;how&#x2019;s&#x2019; of music theory, which I think is the greatest strength of this book. Stone pinpoints and explains many of the most common struggles and stumbling blocks students encounter in learning music theory, which undoubtedly comes from his years of devoted teaching experience. Students are not just instructed on how to do things but are guided to understand why and how certain musical and theoretical phenomenon are preferred and emphasized in the common practice period. While reading, students will continue to find themselves exclaiming &#x2018;Aha! That&#x2019;s why!&#x2019; (Sookkyung Cho, assistant professor of piano and artist performer, Grand Valley State University)<br><br>Stone's text encourages both knowledge and creativity. While instructors will welcome its adaptability to a variety of curricular plans, students will appreciate the clarity of writing and the breadth of repertoire. The chapters covering popular music are to be celebrated.

Ever since Darwin, the evolutionary histories of organisms have been portrayed in the form of branching trees or ";phylogenies.";&nbsp; However, the broad significance of the phylogenetic trees has come to be appreciated only quite recently. Phylogenetics has myriad applications in biology, from discovering the features present in ancestral organisms, to finding the sources of invasive species and infectious diseases, to identifying our closest living (and extinct) hominid relatives.&nbsp; Taking a conceptual approach, Tree Thinking introduces readers to the interpretation of phylogenetic trees, how these trees can be reconstructed, and how they can be used to answer biological questions. Examples and vivid metaphors are incorporated throughout, and each chapter concludes with a set</p><p><p>David A. Baum is a professor at the University of Wisconsin, where he conducts research in plant systematics, systematic theory, and plant evolutionary developmental genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Population and Evolutionary Biology from Washington University in 1991, conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Wisconsin, and then served as Assistant and Associate Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He returned to the University of Wisconsin in 2001, and is now Professor and Chair of Botany and Director of the James F. Wright Institute for the Study of Evolution.

His first published piece was in the C<i>omic Reader </i>#183, a spot illustration of Red Sonja (pg. 9). His first published front cover was the <i>Comic Reader</i> #196; <i>Dominic Fortune, the Spirit,</i> and <i>Doc Savage</i> in November of 1981. Mike Mignola began inking in August of 1983 for Marvel Comics. He inked issues of comic books such as <i>Daredevil</i> (#197 'Introducing' him), <i>Power Man &amp; Iron Fist</i>. Mignola is particularly noted for his highly distinctive style, which was once called "German expressionism meets Jack Kirby" by Alan Moore, in an introduction to a collection of Mignola's <i>Hellboy </i>works. While Mignola has heavily influenced a new generation of comics artists since he began working on Hellboy, he was something of an odd man out in the superhero comics industry in the beginning of his career. Mignola's imagery stood in stark contrast to the style of his contemporaries. Where others would draw muscular men and slim, well-endowed women, Mignola's characters were usually bulky and rough-looking, and more often than not defined by large shadowed areas rather than fine details. Mignola often takes the same approach to architecture, particularly in <i>Hellboy,</i> where he often sets the scenes in slowly dilapidating Victorian and Gothic surroundings. He also commonly draws machines that feature steampunk imagery. <i>Hellboy</i> was made into a feature film in 2004 by director Guillermo del Toro. Mignola was closely involved with the movie's production and a sequel is currently in development. Recently, <i>Hellboy</i> has been made into two direct-to-video animated films, <i>Sword of Storms</i> and <i>Blood and Iron</i> in 2007. Prior to that, Mignola worked as an illustrator for Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 movie <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i>. He was also the production designer for the Disney feature film, <i>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> in 2001, and was a concept artist for 2002's <i>Blade II</i>, also directed by del Toro. Mignola's <i>The Amazing Screw-On Head</i> debuted in 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel, starring the voices of Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce</p><h2>Aikido in Everyday Life: Giving in to Get Your Way</h2><p>Conflict is an unavoidable aspect of living. The late renowned aikido master Terry Dobson, together with Victor Miller, present aikido as a basis for conflict resolution. &#34;Attack-tics&#34; is a system of conflict resolution based on the principles of aikido, the non-violent martial art Morihei Ueshiba created after World War II. Not all conflicts are contests, say Dobson and Miller, and not all conflicts are equally threatening.</p><p>Terry Dobson studied in Japan for ten years with the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba. Before his death in late 1992, he had taught aikido for twenty-five years and brought its principles to conflict management and personal growth seminars in education, mediation and business.<br><br>Victor Miller is a television and film writer living in Milford, Connecticut.

He wants the kingdom to stay united after his death, but all three sons want to rule and it is likely to be torn apart by revolution. Henry favors the youngest John, while Eleanor favors the eldest, Richard. Middle son Geoffrey hopes to play both ends against each other and come out on top. Henry would like to have another heir by his mistress Alais, but that would only add to the confusion. Uneasy is the head on which the crown lies, and uneasy the truce between a matchless king and queen.

The American Revolution is being fought in the hills around Letty Wright&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s farm, and the Wrights must flee to safety. There is no time for Letty to bring Solomon the gander. Letty hopes the British don&#x2019;t hurt Solomon, but hungry soldiers aren&#x2019;t known for their kindness. Eight-year-old Letty tries the only thing she can think of to save him&#x2014;and is as surprised as the other colonists when it works.

She lives in DeKalb, IL. <p>Ellen Beier has most recently illustrated the picture book <em>Blue Hill Meadows</em> by Cynthia Rylant. </p>The setting of this I Can Read is 1778, when British soldiers invade the American colonies, forcing Letty to leave behind the one possession she values most--her gander, Solomon. She places a note to the soldiers on the mantle, begging them to save the life of her bird. Her family piles into the wagon, and heads for the hills, to safety. Waiting is agony: From their hideaway with friends, Letty's family can hear gunshots, and see the smoke of burning houses; travelers' tales of plundering offer little reassurance. When Letty and her family finally return, their house has been ransacked, but it's still standing. On the mantle is a note, in verse, from the soldiers, who have spared Solomon's life and left a bag full of British pennies to pay for the geese they devoured. Along with the realistic watercolors, Walker maintains the inherent suspense of the story throughout; new readers will be glued to the pages right to the rewarding conclusion.

But when a teenage girl falls to her death from Liberty&#39;s ledge, Anna wonders if the suicide was actually a homicide-and begins an investigation that puts her in the line of fire.</p><p>Imagine Nevada Barr's delight in discovering that there is actually a national park right smack in the middle of New York City--Gateways Park, which encompasses Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. She could continue her splendid series about park ranger Anna Pigeon and still do some serious shopping at Bendel's and Berghdorf's, the kind of stores you don't find in the New Mexico cave setting of <i>Blind Descent</i> (her last adventure). The ploy works: Barr is probably the only mystery writer who could see a natural environment under New York's slick and sleazy skin. <p> Anna is in Manhattan to look after her sister Molly, seriously ill with pneumonia and a kidney infection. Pigeon moves in with a ranger friend who has a place on Ellis Island. There's not much natural wildlife unless you count her feathered namesakes, but she still manages to find a lot to contemplate--especially the suspicious suicide of a teenage girl who leaps from Liberty's ledge, followed not long after by the security guard who tried to stop her. But Anna's snooping puts her own life in jeopardy. She survives several attacks and a near drowning--events as frightening as any of the fires, floods, and hurricanes from her past adventures. Barr neatly ties up her plot--ending with a brilliant chase scene across the waters from Manhattan to Liberty Island. What next for Anna? Is there a national park in Las Vegas? <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>There is peril beneath the watchful eyes of the Lady...<p>When Anna Pigeon left New York City after her husband was killed, she hoped it would be forever. But now her sister Molly is clinging to life in an uptown hospital ICU, so Anna has reluctantly returned, Rooming with a friend and fellow park ranger in close quarters on Liberty Island -- the small strip of land that is home to Lady Liberty -- Anna spends her free time exploring the grand monument and the crumbliing, overgrown, and eerie ruins in the unrestored sections of nearby Ellis Island. But the peace she seeks here is shattered when she finds herself among a crowd gathered at the Lady's base, staring at the broken body of a teenager who fell -- or was pushed -- to her death.</p><p>The reason behind the young girl's fatal plunge is not the only mystery alive on these historic sites -- nor will hers be the only death. Hidden in a dangerous labyrinth of stone, glass, and steel are secrets Anna Pigeon is now compelled to uncover...and an insidious threat to herself and to others that could wreak havoc on a nation's proudest day.</p></p><h2>Why True Love Waits: The Definitive Book on How to Help Your Kids Resist Sexual Pressure</h2><p>How can parents, youth workers, and teachers help teens resist the immense pressure to be sexually active before marriage?

It seems like a simple case but it soon escalates into a terrible nightmare. Someone is replicating the killing styles of the most infamous murderers of all time. No one knows this criminal's motives...or who will die next.<br><br>Two ex-Secret Service agents, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, have been hired to defend a man's innocence in a burglary involving an aristocratic family. Then a series of secrets leads the partners right into the frantic hunt that is confounding even the FBI. Now King and Maxwell are playing the <i>Hour Game</i>, uncovering one horrifying revelation after another and putting their lives in danger. For the closer they get to the truth, the closer they get to the most shocking surprise of all.</p><p>Two disgraced former Secret Service officers team up to solve a series of copy-cat crimes in this exciting new thriller by a master of the game. Sean King was momentarily distracted when a presidential candidate he'd been guarding was assassinated a few feet from where he stood, and Michelle Maxwell left the Service under a similar cloud when she lost a "protectee" to an ingenious kidnapping scheme, events told in Baldacci's typical terse, fast-paced style in <i>Split Second</i>. Now partners in a private investigation firm in a small Virginia town, they're hired to investigate a burglary at the home of a wealthy local family. But even before the chief suspect in the break-in meets his death in a gruesome slaying reminiscent of a serial killer long since caught and punished, King and Maxwell get caught up in a string of other murders, each of which copies the techniques of another madman, from San Francisco's Zodiac Killer to Chicago's infamous John Wayne Gacy. While the two protagonists aren't especially complex or well-developed, the action never stops, and Baldacci's trademark pacing keeps the reader turning pages until the denouement, which unfortunately isn't quite as satisfying as the rest of the novel. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p> </p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> <b><i>Why Hour Game</i>: An Exclusive Essay by David Baldacci</b> <br></p><p> It's hard not to notice that the majority of fictional serial killers are cut from the same mold.

&#x201c;Unless you do exactly what you&#x2019;re told,&#x201d; whispered a voice, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll kill your wife and daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words dug into Trevor Plympton&#x2019;s brain like railroad spikes.&nbsp; He sat on the chair, wrists bound to the arm rests with plastic pipe ties, ankles tied to the wheeled feet of the chair.&nbsp; A hood over his head that let in no light.&nbsp; He was lost in a world of darkness and fear.&nbsp; And those words.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could barely remember what happened.&nbsp; He&#x2019;d taken the elevator to the basement parking garage, clicked open the locks on his Vauxhall Astra, felt a sharp burn against the back of his neck and then nothing.&nbsp; When he finally woke up he was already lashed to the chair.&nbsp; He&#x2019;d cried out in alarm, tried yelling for help.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A heavy had belted him across the face.&nbsp; A savage blow, made worse by the absolute surprise of it.&nbsp; He couldn&#x2019;t see it coming, could not even brace against it or turn away.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the whispering voice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;W...what...?&#x201d;&nbsp; It was the best response he could muster.&nbsp; Nothing made sense; the world was a confusion of disorientation, fear and pain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you understand what I said?&#x201d; asked the voice.&nbsp; A male voice.&nbsp; Was there an accent?&nbsp; It was hard to tell with the whisper.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Plympton gasped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tell me what I said.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;T-that you&#x2019;d k-kill my family--.&#x201d;</p><p>A hand clamped onto Plympton&#x2019;s crotch and squeezed with sudden and terrible strength.&nbsp; The pain was white hot and immense.&nbsp; The grip was there and gone, as abrupt as the snap of a steel trap.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s incorrect,&#x201d; said the voice.&nbsp; &#x201c;Try again.&#x201d;</p><p>Plympton whimpered and then suddenly flinched backward, imagining another grab or blow.&nbsp; But there was nothing.&nbsp; After a handful of seconds Plympton relaxed a little.</p><p>Which is when the hand grabbed him again.&nbsp; Harder this time.&nbsp; </p><p>Plympton screamed.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhhh,&#x201d; cautioned the whisperer. &#x201c;Or next time I&#x2019;ll use pliers.&#x201d;</p><p>The scream died in Plympton&#x2019;s throat.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; said the whisper, &#x201c;tell me what I said.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You...said that...&#x201d; Plympton wracked his brain for the exact words.&nbsp; &#x201c;Unless...I did exactly what you said, you&#x2019;d...kill my wife...and daughter.&#x201d;&nbsp; The words were a tangle of fishing hooks in his throat.&nbsp; Ugly words; it was impossible that he was saying them.</p><p>When the hand touched him again it was a gentle pat on the cheek.&nbsp; Even so, Plympton yelped and jumped.</p><p>&#x201c;Better.&#x201d;&nbsp; The man smoothed the hood over Plympton&#x2019;s cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;W-what do you want me to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get to that.&nbsp; What concerns us in this minute is whether you will agree to do whatever I ask.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be easy for you.&nbsp; It will be just another day at work.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;At work?&#x201d;&nbsp; </p><p>A million dreadful possibilities flooded Plympton&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>The whisperer said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to remove the hood because I want to show you something. &nbsp;If you turn your head, your family will die.&nbsp; If you yell or try to escape, your family will die.&nbsp; Do you understand me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God,&#x201d; Plympton said again.&nbsp; Then, before the whisperer could punish him again he said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There won&#x2019;t be a second warning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I swear.&#x201d;</p><p>The whisperer placed his hand on Plympton&#x2019;s head; fingers splayed like a skullcap, and then slowly curled them into a fist around a fold of the hood.&nbsp; He whipped it off so violently that it tore a handful of hairs from Plympton&#x2019;s scalp.</p><p>Plympton almost screamed with the pain, but the warning was too present.</p><p>&#x201c;Open your eyes,&#x201d;</p><p>Plympton obeyed, blinking against the light.&nbsp; As his eyes adjusted he stared in shock and confusion.</p><p>He was in his own house, tied to the chair in his own office.&nbsp; The desk before him was neat and tidy, as he&#x2019;d left it, but the computer monitor had been turned away.&nbsp; No reflection, he thought with bizarre clarity. </p><p>Plympton could not se the man, but he could feel him.&nbsp; And smell him.&nbsp; An odd combination of scents--expensive cologne, cooked meat, gasoline and testosterone.&nbsp; The overall effect was of something large and powerful and wrong behind him, and with a jolt Plympton realized that he&#x2019;d started to think of his captor as a thing rather than a person.&nbsp; A force.</p><p>&#x201c;I want you to look at some pretty pictures,&#x201d; the stranger whispered.&nbsp; </p><p>The man&#x2019;s hand came into Plympton&#x2019;s peripheral vision.&nbsp; Thick forearm, thick wrist, black leather glove.&nbsp; The man laid a photograph down on the desk.&nbsp; The hand vanished and returned with a second picture, and a third, and more until there were six four by six inch photos on the green desk blotter.&nbsp; What Plympton saw in those pictures instantly separated him from the pain that still hummed in his nerve endings.</p><p>Each picture was of a different woman or teenage girl.&nbsp; Three women, three girls.&nbsp; All nude.&nbsp; All dead.&nbsp; The unrelenting clarity of the photos revealed everything which had been done to them.&nbsp; Plympton&#x2019;s mind rebelled against even naming the separate atrocities.&nbsp; To inventory such deliberate savagery was to admit that his own mind could embrace the knowledge that his mind could understand them, and that would be like admitting kinship to the devil Himself.&nbsp; It would break him, and he knew it, so he forced his eyes not to see, his mind not to record.&nbsp; He prayed with every fiber of his being that these things had been done to these women after they were dead.</p><p>Though...he knew that wasn&#x2019;t true.</p><p>The arm reappeared and tapped each photo until it was neat and square with the others in a neat line.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you see?&#x201d; he asked.&nbsp; &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they beautiful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God...&#x201d;&nbsp; It was all Plympton could force past the bile in his throat.</p><p>&#x201c;See this one?&#x201d; The whisperer placed a finger on the corner of the third photo.&nbsp; One of the teenagers. &#x201c;She was the same age as your daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please!&#x201d; Plympton cried.&nbsp; &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t hurt my daughter!&nbsp; For the love of God, please don&#x2019;t hurt my little girl...&#x201d;</p><p>Pain exploded in Plympton&#x2019;s shoulder.&nbsp; It was only after several gasping, inarticulate moments that he was able to understand what had just happened.&nbsp; The whisperer had struck him on a cluster of nerves in the valley between the left trapezes and the side of his neck.&nbsp; It had been fast and horribly precise.&nbsp; The whole left side of his body seemed to catch fire and go numb at the same time.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhhh,&#x201d; cautioned the whisperer.&nbsp; After a long moment the man patted Plympton&#x2019;s shoulder.&nbsp; &#x201c;Good.&nbsp; Now...I have two more pictures to show you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; sobbed Plympton.&nbsp; He closed his eyes, but then the whisperer&#x2019;s lips were right there by his ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Open your eyes or I&#x2019;ll cut off your eyelids, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Plympton mumbled something, nodded.&nbsp; </p><p>The whisperer placed two more four-by-six photos on the desk, arranging them in the center and above the line of six prints.&nbsp; A strangled cry gurgled from Plympton&#x2019;s throat.</p><p>The photos were of his wife and daughter.</p><p>In the first photograph, his wife was wearing only a pair of sheer panties and a demi-cup bra as she leaned her hips against the sink and bent close to the mirror to apply her make-up.&nbsp; Her face wore the bland expression of someone who believes they are totally alone and who is completely absorbed in the minutiae of daily routine.&nbsp; The picture had been taken from behind so that she was seen from the backs of her knees to above her head, with the front of her from hips to hair in the mirror.&nbsp; Plympton&#x2019;s heart sank.&nbsp; Laura looked as pale and beautiful now as she had when they&#x2019;d first met twenty-two years ago.&nbsp; And he loved her with his whole heart.</p><p>That heart threatened to tear loose from his chest as he looked at the second picture.</p><p>His daughter, Zo�.&nbsp; Fifteen years old and the image of her mother, except that instead of mature elegance Zo� had a lush coltish grace.&nbsp; In the photo, Zo� was naked, her young body steaming with hot water as she stepped out of the shower over the rim of the tub, on hand raised to push aside a shower curtain that had a pattern of swirling stars.&nbsp; Plympton saw his daughter in her unguarded nakedness and it awoke in him a hot fury &#x2013;an inferno of murderous rage that flooded his arms with power.&nbsp; His whole body tensed, but then the whisperer said: &#x201c;We have someone watching them both right now.&nbsp; We are watching them every minute or ev...</p></p><h2>How to Resist Amazon and Why (Real World)</h2><p>When a company&#x2019;s workers are literally dying on the job, and its business model relies on preying on local businesses and even their own companies, and its CEO is the richest person in the world while its workers make minimum wage with impossible quotas...wouldn&#x2019;t you want to resist?

What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven. England was deserted, for Christ and his saints were sleeping. I had never even heard of these royals. Queen Maud was the legitimate heir to the throne, but a woman, and there fore not fit to rule. She is also the mother of Henry, who later married Eleanor of Aquitaine . Pretty heady stuff, more incredible men and women, another book to get totally lost in. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been years since all these books were first published, I can name 5 stores I have been in in the past 3 months that have one of these titles in the Staff Recommends section.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales Manger</p>"Penman's characters are so shrewdly imagined, so full of resonant human feeling that they seem to be on the page....Most compelling is the portrait of the Welsh as wild and rugged as their landscape."<br>SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE<br>Here, alive from the pages of history, is the compelling tale of a Celtic society ruled by Llewelyn, Prince of Wales, on a collison course with a feudal realm of Edward I. WIth this last book in the extraordinary trilogy that began with HERE BE DRAGONS and continued in FALLS THE SHADOW, Sharon Kay Penman has written a beautiful and moving conclusion to her medieval saga. For everyone who has read the earlier books in this incomparable series or ever wanted to experience the rich tapestry of British history and lore, this bold and romantic adventure must be read.</p><h2>Kitharologus, The Path to Virtuosity: A Technical Workout Manual for All Guitarists</h2><p>Guitar virtuoso Ricardo Iznaola&#x2019;s exciting technical workout manual Kitharologus is designed to help all guitarists attain virtuosity, regardless of their present playing ability by following well laid-out practice routines of basic skills.

Vastly outnumbered, the patrols faced overwhelming odds as they fought to carry out their missions, from gathering intelligence, acting as hunter/killer teams, or engaging in infamous &#x201c;Parakeet&#x201d; flights&#x2013; actions in which teams were dropped into enemy areas and expected to &#x201c;develop&#x201d; the situation. <br><br>PHANTOM WARRIORS II presents heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat stories from individuals and teams. These elite warriors relive sudden deadly firefights, prolonged gun battles with large enemy forces, desperate attempts to help fallen comrades, and the sheer hell of bloody, no-quarter combat. The LRRP accounts here are a testament to the courage, guts, daring, and sacrifice of the men who willingly faced death every day of their lives in Vietnam.</p><p><b>Gary A. Linderer</b> is the publisher of <i>Behind the Lines</i>, a magazine that specializes in U.S. military special operations. In Vietnam he served with the LRPs of the 101st Airborne Division, earning two Silver Stars, the Bronze Star with V device (for valor), the Army Commendation Medal with V device, and two Purple Hearts.Introduction<br><br>As a matter of historical importance, the 1982 Veterans Day dedication of the Vietnam Memorial was a time of realization, of opening wounds that had<br>scabbed over in time, but now were bleeding profusely. It was also a time intermixed with extreme joy and pride. I distantly recall now a gathering in Washington, D.C., during the dedication of the memorial in November<br>1982, when a handful of LRRP, LRP, and Rangers, along with author Lee Lanning and publisher Owen Lock, gathered in a hotel hospitality suite to comfort<br>ourselves with men who had common experiences and to seek refuge from the scores of news reporters lurking about looking for stories.<br><br>In the course of our impromptu meeting we recalled fallen teammates, both American and Vietnamese, and courage and moral resolve under tremendously trying<br>circumstances. We also spoke of the courage and ability of the North Vietnamese Army, Viet Cong, and Warsaw Pact counterparts who faced us, serving as the measure of the danger, daring, and resolve we contested as members<br>of LRRP/Ranger units, lest we be delusional in our chest beating and paint a fantasy picture of extremes that would for the most part be untrue to what really took place. I was grateful for this, for, as a Sicangu<br><br>Lakota Kit Fox soldier, it had been a long-standing tradition in the Tokala Society to recognize your enemy and his courage as a measure of your own ability and courage. A long-dead Sicangu Tokala elder once said, "If you cannot respect your enemy as your equal, how can you respect yourself?&#x201d; However, over Jack Daniels, copious rum and Cokes, and sundry drinks, a consensus<br>was reached among us former LRRPs, LRPs and Rangers: we needed a formal organization, an organization capable of representing and substantiating our<br>combined historical experiences. In relation to this organization,<br>a conduit would be needed to give our folks the opportunity to tell their stories, not in the manner of the clinical, official, military unit histories and after-action reports, but more in the form of individual and<br>team oral histories based on accurate recollection of their missions.<br><br>One of the chief drivers behind all of this was 101st Airborne Division LRRP/Ranger veteran Kenn Miller, whose influence among us grew out of his LRRP experience and his extremely well-received novel based on it, Tiger the LRRP Dog. Inspired by Miller's book and the advice of Owen Lock, Lee Lanning, and some of the boys who were lawyers, we were reminded by those gathered in that hospitality suite that organization and media are and were important in telling our story. Armed with this knowledge, the task was then to "operationalize"<br>an organization and to allow a conduit to develop to debrief our guys and formulate individual and team experiences into accurate stories.<br><br>Most of us felt an urgent need to organize in order to counter the tales of the wanna-bes, for lack of a better word, and those who are prone to rewrite fact so as to build their social standing within and without the LRRP/Ranger community. We had all watched the Special Forces and SEAL veterans experience the "Rambo phenomenon" as the Vietnam Memorial festivities unfolded around us in 1982; it appeared that every "ragbag" in the world was drawn to the Wall and to the reunions. All of course were the "only survivors" of outrageously improbable missions, and in most cases their descriptions of their exploits outdid the authentic veterans of real missions. Granted, time and the individual's perception of combat often affect the description of actual events but, clearly many of those claiming special warfare experience in Vietnam-as LRRPs/LRPs/Rangers, SEALs, Force Recon and Battalion Recon, Special Forces, Air Commandos, etc.-had penetrated no closer to actual combat than the local surplus store. That said, we must discuss the importance of the evolution of the code of honor that had been passed to us by the early rangers and raiders, the Indian Scout service, Darby's Rangers, Merrill's Marauders, the Alamo Scouts, and the Korean Rangers, to name a few similar units. In almost ten years of combat operations in Vietnam, and by happen-stance, we refashioned the code by our resolve and our courage so well that later that code of honor was summarized<br>by Command Sgt. Maj. Neal Gentry in the form of the Ranger Creed. This code and creed still works its magic and influences moral responsibility of most of us on a daily basis. If one becomes quiet and mindful enough, the words can still be heard through time itself:<br><br>If one goes, we all go; an LRRP never leaves an LRRP behind; once an LRRP, always an LRRP; Rangers lead the way. <br><br>Mind you, there are those who are unconscious of this simple code, but those who are not in such an altered state of consciousness are indeed mindful of it. It echoes still, in our modern day LRSUs and the Ranger Regiment, where the Ranger Creed is the moral foundation of the unit.<br><br>Besides having the honor of being asked to write this introduction to Gary Linderer's Phantom Warriors Book Two, make no question that this book and the series of books he has produced are the stories of the courage and resolve of outstanding team leaders and heroic team members. Often, time shades the events of the past. In combat, in those brief firefights or pro-longed battles, or in the sheer trauma of no-quarter combat, the truth is often misplaced by the war story. This results from the many perceptions of individuals experiencing the trauma of combat and the passage of time. Gary Linderer has developed not only a conduit for recording history, but a method of debriefing team members in a way G-2 and S-2 could never accomplish. He has in the process of writing these books allowed the team members to reconstruct and substantiate the events of the day among themselves, and even though it has been acknowledged that a story may have forgotten something or overlooked someone, the interesting thing is that every effort to provide a clear and accurate ac-count of the patrol's activities and teammates' thoughts has been made. These books are the accounts of the combined experiences of these teams, and not war stories. There is no chest beating or a "there I was..." tale, only a story of six good and very brave men who never wavered in duty or in the light of the Ranger Creed, and that's as good as it gets.<br><br>-Tom Roubideaux<br>1st Brigade LRRP, 101st Airborne Division;<br>Brigade LRRP, 173d Airborne Brigade;<br>74th Inf.

He is the focus of a five-part PBS television series with Bill Moyers and has taught at Washington University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley. The recipient of twelve honorary degrees, Smith's fifteen books include his bestselling <em>The World's Religions</em>, <em>Why Religion Matters</em>, and his autobiography, <em>Tales of Wonder</em>. </p><br><br><p>Philip Novak is the Santo Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Religion at Dominican University in San Rafael, California, where he has taught for over twenty years, and the author of <em>The World's Wisdom</em>, a widely used anthology of the sacred texts of the world's religions and the companion reader to Huston Smith's <em>The World's Religions</em>.</p>Bookshelves abound with introductions to Buddhism, many written by luminaries and spiritual giants of the faith. But this primer co-written by Smith, whose magnum opus The World's Religions has sold more than two million copies, is distinguished by its gentlemanly erudition and thoughtful attention to Buddhist diversity. The book's first half is an expanded and updated version of the Buddhism sections of The World's Religions and was penned by Smith. Special attention is given to Theravada Buddhism, which "was overshadowed by Mahayana" in the original version; one chapter provides a helpful side-by-side chart illuminating the basic differences between the traditions, while the next features an in-depth discussion of Theravada's influence in South Asia and its emphasis on insight meditation. The primer's all-new second half-written by Smith's former doctoral student Novak-presents the story of Buddhism in the West, discussing its multifaceted presence in the United States. While Novak devotes time to the rise of Buddhism in Germany, England and France, it is clear that he finds the "New Buddhism" of America, with its emphasis on lay involvement, social engagement and the cross-pollination between Buddhist traditions, to be the source of the most exciting contemporary innovations. Smith's helpful afterword gauges the rising importance of Pure Land Buddhism in America, though this vital information should have merited a full chapter. Novak and Smith's collaboration is a fine contribution to the admittedly crowded corpus of introductions to Buddhism: the strokes are broad, the writing style engaging and the chapters short and accessible. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Egyptian Cinderella</h2><p><p><strong><strong>"A stunning combination of fluent prose and exquisitely wrought illustrations" <em>(School Library Journal).</em></strong> "An inventive twist on the classic tale"<em> (Publishers Weekly).</em></strong></p><p>This Egyptian spin on the classic Cinderella tale was initially recorded in the first century by a Roman historian and is&nbsp;retold here by folklorist Shirley Climo.</p><p>Poor Rhodopis!

Wilson </b> <br><br> This eye-opening book by the legendary author of the National Book Award-winning <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> persuasively details a new approach to our stewardship of the planet. Lifelong ecologist and futurist Stewart Brand relies on scientific rigor to shatter myths concerning nuclear energy, urbanization, genetic engineering, and other controversial subjects, showing exactly where the sources of our dilemmas lie and offering a bold, inventive set of policies and design- based solutions for shaping a more sustainable society. Thought- provoking and passionately argued, this is a pioneering book on one of the hottest issues facing humanity today.</p><p>Though honored as a writer&#x2014;with the National Book Award for the <b>Whole Earth Catalog</b>, Eliot Montroll Award for <b>The Media Lab</b>, Golden Gadfly Award for his years as editor of <b>CoEvolution Quarterly</b>&#x2014;<b>Steward Brand</b> is primarily an inventor/designer. Trained as a biologist and army officer, he was an early multimedia artist. He has created a number of lasting institutions, including New Games Tournaments, the Hackers Conference, and The WELL, a bellwether computer conference system. He is co-founder of Global Business Network, a futurist research organization fostering "the art of the long view."Brand, co-author of the seminal 1969 <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, compiles reflections and lessons learned from more than 40 years as an environmentalist in this clumsy yet compelling attempt to inspire practicable solutions to climate change. Brand haphazardly organizes his manifesto into chapters that address environmental stewardship opportunities, exhorting environmentalists to become fearless about following science; his iconoclastic proposals include transitioning to nuclear energy and ecosystem engineering. Brand believes environmentalists must embrace nuclear energy expansion and other inevitable technological advances, and refreshingly suggests a shift in the environmentalists' dogmatic approach to combating climate change. Rejecting the inflexible message so common in the Green movement, he describes a process of reasonable debate and experimentation. Brand's fresh perspective, approachable writing style and manifest wisdom ultimately convince the reader that the future is not an abyss to be feared but an opportunity for innovative problem solvers to embrace enthusiastically. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the original edition, Steiner provided readers with the first systematic investigation since the eighteenth century of the phenomenology and processes of translation both inside and between languages. Taking issue with the principal emphasis of modern linguistics, he finds the root of the "Babel problem" in our deep instinct for privacy and territory, noting that every people has in its language a unique body of shared secrecy. With this provocative thesis he analyzes every aspect of translation from fundamental conditions of interpretation to the most intricate of linguistic constructions.<br> For the long-awaited second edition, Steiner entirely revised the text, added new and expanded notes, and wrote a new preface setting the work in the present context of hermeneutics, poetics, and translation studies. This new edition brings the bibliography up to the present with substantially updated references, including much Russian and Eastern European material. Like the towering figures of Derrida, Lacan, and Foucault, Steiner's work is central to current literary thought. <em>After Babel, Third Edition</em> is essential reading for anyone hoping to understand the debates raging in the academy today.<br></p><p><br><strong>George Steiner</strong> is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva.

The result is one of the most significant texts in the history of ethics, and a masterpiece of Enlightenment thinking. Kant argues that moral law tells us to act only in ways that others could also act, thereby treating them as ends in themselves and not merely as means. Kant contends that despite apparent threats to our freedom from science, and to ethics from our self-interest, we can nonetheless take ourselves to be free rational agents, who as such have a motivation to act on this moral law, and thus the ability to act as moral beings.<br><br>One of the most studied works of moral philosophy, this new translation by Robert Stern, Joe Saunders, and Christopher Bennett illuminates this famous text for modern readers.<br></p><p><br>Immanuel Kant<br><br>Christopher Bennett is Reader in Philosophy at the University of Sheffield.

The path of Mo Pai develops the practitioner in the present life, but also ascends the practitioner in status with regards to the afterlife. In the present life, the goal of Mo Pai is to develop supernatural abilities capable of aiding an individual both in self-defense and in the rejuvenation of the physical body. Concerning the afterlife, the true master of Mo Pai reserves the ability to consciously navigate their soul after the death of the physical body, freeing themselves from the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. </p> <p> The greatest Mo Pai practitioner on Earth today, Master John Chang, has publicly displayed his extraordinary developments to the world by performing many spectacular abilities on video such as <i>electrokinesis, pyrokinesis, levitation, suspended animation, and telekinesis.</i> </p><p>In order to attain supernatural capacities, this ancient training augments the innate potential of the human body through gathering and harnessing the two fundamental life-force energies known as Yin Chi and Yang Chi. These two energies are abundant in nature and play an important role in sustaining the human body. Developing these vital energies to levels that many would consider unnatural, the Mo Pai student quickly gains an edge when compared to the average human. </p> <p> Included in this book is an analysis of the Mo Pai training and the techniques used for gathering, manipulating, and finally combining the two fundamental vital energies of Yang Chi and Yin Chi.</p> <p> <b>Analysis of:</b><br> -Level 1<br> -Level 2 <br>-Level 3 <br>-Level 4 <br>-Levels 5-72<br></p> <br></p><p><p> JAMES VAN GELDER has studied energy cultivation from various avenues including Western Hermetics, Daoist Energy Cultivation/Nei Gong, Tibetan Buddhist Alchemy, and the systems of Indian Kundalini Yoga. </p> <p> <b>Foreword</b></p> <p>Derrick Arnold: Internal martial arts instructor, herbalist, academic, and author.<i> Editions printed before 11/07/15 will not have the foreword included.</i></p> <p> <b>Editorial Reviews</b></p> <p> &#x201c;Well researched training manual that references a variety of Mo Pai masters, with visuals and quotes.

Ancient wisdom is timeless. It teaches us what we are reawakening to as a society; we are spiritual beings and once we realize that our existence far exceeds the confines of the physical, our potential and our power can be limitless. The author does a great job of summarizing the experiences of Jim McMillan and John Chang. This book can serve as the perfect companion piece to these readings outlined in this work. For those who are complete novices, the book can also be a great introduction because it outlines these practices in a way that is easily accessible to a wide audience.

What should a disciple of Jesus look and act like today? What is the relationship between discipleship and salvation, between discipleship and sanctification, between discipleship and ministry? How were disciples of Jesus different from other disciples in the ancient world? How did the early church carry out Jesus' agenda in "making disciples of all the nations"? In Following the Master, Michael J. Wilkins addresses these and many other questions that perplex the church today- not by offering another discipleship program or manual but by presenting a comprehensive biblical theology of discipleship. Following the Master compares other forms of master-disciple relationships in existence in the ancient Judaism and Greco-Roman world, traces Jesus' steps as he called and developed disciples, and Mediterranean world as it followed Jesus' command to make disciples. Following the Master lays the groundwork necessary for developing biblical discipleship ministries in the church, on the mission field, and in parachurch ministries. It is essential reading for all pastors, students, and Christian workers.</p></p><p><p>Michael J.

It can be compared to Izaak Walton's legendary fishing treatise, <i>The Compleat Angler</i>. This new edition, from Incandescence Press, includes a new introduction, notes, and author bio, as well as a beautiful new type setting that closely replicates the 1878 original.<br><br> Maurice Thompson was considered, in his own time, among the most important authors of the "New South" in the United States.

Increasingly disillusioned by the rejection slips that studded the walls of his room and his on/off engagement to Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald began his third revision of the novel that was to become This Side of Paradise. The story of a young man&#39;s painful sexual and intellectual awakening that echoes Fitzgerald&#39;s own career, it is also a portrait of the lost generation that followed straight on from the First World War, &#39;grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken&#39; and wanting money and success more than anything else.</p><p>Fitzgerald&#39;s first novel, reprinted in the handsome Everyman&#39;s Library series of literary classic, uses numerous formal experiments to tell the story of Amory Blaine, as he grows up during the crazy years following the First World War. It also contains a new introduction by Craig Raine that describes critical and popular reception of the book when it came out in 1920.F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text. This new edition brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald&#39;s original manuscript.</p><h2>65 Drunkard&#39;s Path Quilt Designs (Dover Quilting)</h2><p><p>If you've always wanted to try the deliciously meandering Drunkard's Path pattern, but were put off by the pattern's reputation for difficulty, help is at hand.

And did Judeo-Christian religion really turn its back on women? These are some of the questions that scholar and feminist Tivka Frymer-Kensky sets out to answer in this iconoclastic study of gender in religions past and present. Her argument, illustrated with fascinating accounts of myth and ritual dating back to the early days of Sumer, Assyria, and Greece, is that although polytheism did accord females an important role, the strict division between male and female actually served to keep women in a subordinate position. The goddesses were progressively "ghettoized": their sphere was eventually relegated to home and hearth, while male gods took over as patrons of wisdom and learning. This dualism was displaced by the Bible, which embraced a surprisingly egalitarian view of human nature in which women were not considered to be inherently inferior.<br><br>In a provocative work of biblical scholarship on gender and sexuality, Frymer-Kensky shows that the ideal of monotheism may offer far more to us today than a return to the gender-based worldview of the goddess religions.</p><p>"Offers a more complicated and more interesting and more accurate view of the role of female divinities in human life."<p>The New Republic</p><p></p><p>"A deeply thought-through radical critique of sexism underlies this analysis, matched by a profound respect for the Bible and the tradition honoring it."</p><p>Penny Gill, Ph.D.</p><p>Emily Dickinson Professor of Humanities</p><p>Mount Holyoke College</p><p>"Presents many marvelous insights into biblical theology, sexuality, and anthropology that will surely claim the attention of scholars and students of biblical religion and culture for years to come."</p><p>Walter Harrelson, Ph.D.</p><p>Professor of Religion emeritus</p><p>Vanderbilt University</p><b>Tikva Frymer-Kensky</b>&nbsp;was a professor of Hebrew bible at the Divinity School at the University of Chicago.

In other words, we spend a lot of money to anticipate problems, identify opportunities, and avoid mistakes. A substantial portion of what we spend&#x2015;over $50 billion a year&#x2015;goes to the US Intelligence Community.</p> <p><i>Reducing Uncertainty</i> describes what Intelligence Community analysts do, how they do it, and how they are affected by the political context that shapes, uses, and sometimes abuses their output. In particular, it looks at why IC analysts pay more attention to threats than to opportunities, and why they appear to focus more on warning about the possibility of "bad things" happening than on providing the input necessary for increasing the likelihood of positive outcomes. </p> <p>The book is intended to increase public understanding of what IC analysts do, to elicit more relevant and constructive suggestions for improvement from outside the Intelligence Community, to stimulate innovation and collaboration among analysts at all grade levels in all agencies, and to provide a core resource for students of intelligence. The most valuable aspect of this book is the in-depth discussion of National Intelligence Estimates&#x2015;what they are, what it means to say that they represent the "most authoritative judgments of the Intelligence Community," why and how they are important, and why they have such high political salience and symbolic importance. The final chapter lays out, from an insider's perspective, the story of the flawed Iraq WMD NIE and its impact on the subsequent Iran nuclear NIE&#x2015;paying particular attention to the heightened political scrutiny the latter received in Congress following the Iraq NIE debacle.</p></p><p>Thomas Fingar is the Oksenberg/Rohlen Distinguished Fellow in the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.

Line by line, Connelly shows how the poem draws on and expresses elements from the thousand years of Buddhist thought that preceded it, expands on the poem's depiction of a life of simple practice in nature, and tells stories of the way these teachings manifest in modern life. Connelly, like Shitou before him, proves himself adept at taking profound and complex themes from Zen and laying them out in a practical and understandable way. <br>Eminently readable, thoroughly illuminating, <i>Inside the Grass Hut</i> shows the reader a path of wholehearted engagement -- with the poem, and with the world.

Author: Sharon Salzberg, author of Real Happiness<br><br>&#x201c;Written from the inside out, this wonderful book explores Zen Master Shitou's marvelous and revelatory poem &#x2018;Song of the Grass Roof Hemitage.&#x2019; The language and sense of immediacy makes Shitou's work transparent to all.&#x201d; Author: Joan Halifax, founding abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br><br>&#x201c;A great addition to the latest stage in the development of Buddhist books by Westerners for Western audiences: the careful commentary to a traditional text. This stage follows the Dharma talk book and the general intro book, necessities for introducing the general reader to Buddhist teaching. That having been done, we are now ready for something with more depth, and the audience is well prepared for it, and seeks it. Connelly has what it takes to accomplish this task: a deep and detailed knowledge of Buddhist philosophy and the ability to write about it in an informal, engaging, and understandable way. This book is easy and pleasant to read, with plenty of wit, and with many examples from daily life. There's humor, deft turning of phrase, even some paradox and poetry.&#x201d; Author: Norman Fischer, author of Training in Compassion<br><br>"This lovely book is an invitation to experience calm and ease while looking deeply into who lives in the grass hut. It is a wonderful guidebook on the path to being a wiser and kinder human being delighting in a simple, natural way of life." Author: Ellen Birx, author of Selfless Love<br><br><i>"Inside the Grass Hut</i> is a clear, charitable presentation of Zen tradition and practice. Connelly provides fresh, insightful interpretations of Shitou&#x2019;s classic poem, directly applicable to zendo and daily life. But striking, too, is the personal and serene tone of the writing, of the instructive exposition, which infuses the book with a living pulse and -- what I will dare to call here -- the very essence of Zen." Author: Mike O&#x2019;Connor, translator of Where the World Does Not Follow<br><br>"Ben Connelly sensitively re-imagines for the modern reader Shitou's timeless poem about what it means to be fully alive in the world. Written not just for Zen practitioners, this lovely book offers insights and encouragement to all who seek to live in the simplicity of the present moment."

Halloween arrives early this year to rural central Virginia, when a twisted killer will stop at nothing to protect a multimillion-dollar scheme.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE LITTER OF THE LAW</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Autumn has descended and crops are being harvested all over Crozet, Virginia, ideal conditions for a scenic drive for Harry and husband Fair. Bucolic views are all well and good, but Harry&#x2019;s nose for trouble leads her straight to a cornfield&#x2019;s macabre scarecrow&#x2014;an all too real murder victim that frightens all but the noisy crows.<br> &nbsp;<br> This accountant&#x2019;s gruesome death is only the first of many disturbing events in this normally pastoral corner of the world. While Harry tends her beloved grapes and sunflowers, a killer edges closer&#x2014;as does Harry&#x2019;s protective menagerie of animals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Halloween&#x2019;s approach brings with it bona fide terror and a beloved local tradition that threatens to become fatal. Rooting out the guilty in the treacherous center of a lucrative conspiracy requires Harry&#x2019;s farmer&#x2019;s wisdom&#x2014;along with the quick wits and extraordinary senses of Sneaky Pie, Pewter, and Tucker. A vicious murderer may know the lay of the land far better than Harry does, but that&#x2019;s about to change. It&#x2019;s up to her vigilant four-footed companions to make sure that the unearthing of this plot is not Harry&#x2019;s last act.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Litter of the Law </i>and the Mrs. Murphy mysteries</b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;As feline collaborators go, you couldn&#x2019;t ask for better than Sneaky Pie Brown.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Enchanting . . .

It reminded them of their courting days, back in high school, when Fair, bruised from Friday night&#x2019;s football game, would pick up Harry, dirty from the stable, and they&#x2019;d drive around in his 1958 Chevy pickup. Now, over two decades later, Fair was at the wheel of their station wagon, Harry beside him, the pets in the back seat, as they rode through the countryside.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, Pewter, her gray, overweight sidekick, and Tucker, the corgi, usually accompanied their people everywhere except in high heat. On a mild day like today, windows down a crack, the three could sleep or chat while the humans talked.<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect weather,&#x201d; Fair declared.<br><br>October 12 was indeed a ravishing fall day&#x2014;�early fall, for the summer warmth lingered late this year. Forests looked spray-�painted with yellow, orange, flaming red, deep red, old gold.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Miranda got the respiratory flu.&#x201d; Harry mentioned a former co-�worker and dear friend. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s swearing that drinking electrolytes will cure her. She saw it on TV.&#x201d;<br><br>Fair shook his head. &#x201c;Electrolytes will help, but our beloved Miranda seems susceptible to quacks.&#x201d;<br><br>Watching the passing scenery, Pewter noticed a lovely yellow clapboard farmhouse. &#x201c;Quack&#x2014;�duck. Why call a crook a quack?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Tucker replied. The corgi was well used to Pewter&#x2019;s inquiring mind. &#x201c;They also use the term &#x2018;snake oil.&#x2019; A quack sells snake oil. It&#x2019;s confusing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; Pewter whooped. &#x201c;If they&#x2019;ll buy snake oil, maybe we can get them hooked on catnip.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Humans don&#x2019;t sniff catnip,&#x201d; Tucker replied with dignity.<br><br>&#x201c;They can learn.&#x201d; The gray cat spoke with conviction.<br><br>&#x201c;Pewter, sometimes I think you&#x2019;re cracked as well as fat,&#x201d; the dog unwisely said.<br><br>&#x201c;Fat!&#x201d; Pewter raged.<br><br>&#x201c;You need a seat all your own.

Harry walked around to the rear of the car and opened the hatch door; the animals jumped back into their original seats.<br><br>Slamming both doors shut, Harry cursed as Fair couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh. She walked over to the driver&#x2019;s side; he had the window down.<br><br>&#x201c;They know how to pluck your last nerve,&#x201d; said Fair, laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours, too. I&#x2019;m not the one who pulled the car over.&#x201d; Harry looked down the road at the produce stand, a small white clapboard building with a large overhang, goods displayed in orderly, colorful rows. &#x201c;Hey, let&#x2019;s get some pattypan squash. Bet Hester still has some.&#x201d; She walked around the car, getting in the passenger side before turning to face her animal tormentors. &#x201c;If I hear one peep, one sniff, one hiss while I am shopping, no food tonight. Got it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hateful.&#x201d; Pewter turned her back on Harry.<br><br>As Tucker hung her head, Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, loudly defended herself. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do one thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not, the perfect puss.&#x201d; Pewter curled her upper lip.<br><br>Fair coasted to the stand, where Hester&#x2014;�orange apron, black jeans, and an orange shirt&#x2014;�was talking to customers, most of whom lived in Crozet or nearby.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay here.&#x201d; Fair knew how Hester could go on, plus Buddy Janss was there, all three hundred pounds of him, and he could outtalk Hester.<br><br>Orange and black bunting festooned the roof overhang. Scarecrows flanked the outdoor wooden cartons overflowing with squashes, pumpkins, every kind of apple imaginable. Inside, one could buy a good sandwich. Little ghosts floated from the rafters; big green eyes glowed in the room&#x2019;s upper corners. Brilliantly gold late corn and huge mums and zinnias added to the color.<br><br>Almost as big as Buddy, a sign sat catty-�cornered to the entrance, announcing the community Halloween Hayride to raise money for the Crozet Library. No doubt Tazio Chappars, an architect, had designed the impressive sign. She worked hard for the library and the sign really grabbed you: From a large drawn skeleton, one bony arm actually reached out to get your attention.<br><br>Hester looked up. &#x201c;Harry Haristeen, I haven&#x2019;t seen you in weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>Buddy turned. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you do with your sunflowers?&#x201d;<br><br>Buddy, a farmer who rented thousands of acres along with cultivating his own holdings, enjoyed Harry&#x2019;s foray into niche farming. Who knew better than Buddy the cost of equipment and implements for wheat, corn, soybeans? Harry had made a wise choice in focusing on her field of sunflowers, her quarter acre of Petit Manseng grapes, and the ginseng she grew down by the strong deep creek that divided her property from the old Jones farm.<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty good,&#x201d; she said, not wanting to brag that this year&#x2019;s field of sunflowers was her biggest yet. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your year so far?&#x201d;<br><br>He hooked his thumbs in his overalls. &#x201c;Tell you what, girl, that mini-�drought thinned out my corn crop. I did better than most because my lower acres received enough rain. Others didn&#x2019;t. Never saw anything like it. On one side of the road the corn would be twisted right up, and on the other just as plump as you&#x2019;d please. The corn behind the old schoolhouses looks poorly.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester jumped in. &#x201c;Government&#x2019;s fault. All that stuff they have circling around up there in space. Gotta affect us.&#x201d;<br><br>Both Harry and Buddy nodded politely, for Hester was a little in space herself. Sometimes a lot out there. Middle-�aged, good-�looking, with glossy light brown hair hanging to her shoulders, she applied just enough makeup to draw attention to her symmetry and health. Every small town as well as big city has its Hesters, it&#x2019;s just they can&#x2019;t hide in the small towns. Good-�looking people, often bright, but they don&#x2019;t quite fit in and often they never marry. Hester had gone to Mary Baldwin, excelled in her studies, but came back over the Blue Ridge Mountains to run this roadside stand. Her brother, more ambitious, moved to Houston right out of the College of William and Mary. He had perfect timing, hitting Texas on the cusp of a building boom and making the most of it. Her parents had built the stand more as a hobby than a business, but it flourished. Her father had been a banker; her mother had run the stand. These days Hester seemed happy enough, engaged with a steady stream of regulars and tourists.<br><br>Buddy kindly semi-�agreed. &#x201c;What scares me is what we don&#x2019;t know. I mean, just in general, look at this drought and, hey, we came out a lot better off than they did in the Midwest, where everything burned up. Right now our water table is good. I planted more Silver Queen corn because I think the weather will stay warm longer. I&#x2019;ll get it harvested and if not, I&#x2019;ll make a lot of critters happy.&#x201d; He let out a booming laugh.<br><br>Hester asked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got crop coverage, Buddy? After the drought of 1988, surely you started paying for an insurance policy, revenue protection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do. I elected an eighty percent revenue protection policy. Yes, I did learn from 1988 but, girl, every time I turn around I&#x2019;m writing another check and I see my return diminish. Farming gets harder and harder,&#x201d; said the well-�organized man, a true steward of the land. &#x201c;Just to keep up, I have to plant more acreage. Plant an early crop, then come back and throw soybeans down. I feel like I&#x2019;m running to stay in place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Think we all do,&#x201d; Hester agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Only way I can buy or rent&#x2014;�and renting makes sense in the short term&#x2014;�is to sell some of my land closer in to Crozet or Charlottesville.&#x201d;<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s shoulders snapped back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that, Buddy. Don&#x2019;t ever do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before I forget, Hester, do you have any pattypan squash?&#x201d; Harry didn&#x2019;t want to keep Fair or the arguing animals in limbo.<br><br>&#x201c;I do. Wait until you see it.&#x201d; Hester nodded to Buddy, who winked at Harry.<br><br>The two women walked inside, where there was crooknecked squash, acorn squash, and Harry&#x2019;s favorite, cream-�white pattypan squash that looked like scalloped discuses.<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful! And the right size.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right about now the pattypan is usually over, but this year with the long, long summer, I&#x2019;m still getting some,&#x201d; said Hester. &#x201c;The melons are over, though. I do so love melons. Before I forget, now, you and Fair are buying tickets for the hayride. You must. The library is built but there&#x2019;s a lot to be done. We need $59,696 just for adult computers and, oh my, the adult area needs tables and we need furniture for a meditative reading room. The list is endless.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course we&#x2019;ll buy tickets. I&#x2019;ll even buy tickets for Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If that gray cat of yours gets any fatter, I&#x2019;ll have to find a special wagon and pony just for her.&#x201d; Hester laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking pretty Halloweeny yourself, all orange and black.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, this is just my warm-�up. Next week I&#x2019;ll be out here in my witch&#x2019;s costume.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So long as you don&#x2019;t scare customers away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could be a Halloween fairy except I&#x2019;ve never seen a Halloween fairy.&#x201d;<br><br>They kept chatting as Harry picked out two succulent squashes, then paid at the cash register run by Lolly Currie, a young woman looking for a better job but making ends meet at Hester&#x2019;s stand until then.<br><br>Back on the road, Fair grinned. &#x201c;That is the shortest time you have ever spent at Martin&#x2019;s Stand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy Janss helped me out, because as soon as I paid for my squash, he came back to chat up Hester, about late produce deliveries. I swear, Buddy has put on more weight. His chins now have chins.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy may be fat but he&#x2019;s light on his feet. He was a hell of a football player in high school and college. It&#x2019;s a pity that retired linemen run to fat so often.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boxers, too.&#x201d; She watched rolling hills pass by.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you should go live with Buddy. The two of you could be Team Tubby.&#x201d; Tucker knew this would start a fight.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy counseled in vain.<br><br>&#x201c;Bubble Butt. Poop Breath!&#x201d; Pewter hissed loudly.<br><br>Harry twisted around in the front seat just in time to see Pewter hook the dog&#x2019;s shoulder with one claw.<br><br>&#x201c;Ouch,&#x201d; Tucker yelped.<br><br>&#x201c;Next, your eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pull over, honey. There will be fur all over the car if I don&#x2019;t stop this right now.&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled over on the side of the road. The field on the north side of the two-�lane road was jammed with corn. Morrowdale Farm usually put these fields in good hay, but this year row after row of healthy corn filled them. They had somehow escaped the small drought.<br><br>Opening the door to again castigate the backseat passengers, Harry remarked, &#x201c;This has to be one of the best-�run and prettiest farms in Albemarle County.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure is.&#x201d;<br><br>They looked out to the scarecrow in the middle of the field, currently being mobbed by crows.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought scarecrows were supposed to frighten crows,&#x201d; Fair said.<br><br>&#x201c;Those crows are having a party. Look at that. Pulling on the wig under the hat.&#x201d; Harry laughed. &#x201c;What are all those birds doing?&#x201d;<br><br>Fair stepped out of the car to stare intently as a crow plucked out an eyeball.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, that&#x2019;s not a scarecrow.&#x201d;<br><br>2<br><br>&#x201c;Tucker, come back!&#x201d; Harry called to the corgi as the dog raced across the cornfield.<br><br>Fair, in his shock, hadn&#x2019;t closed the station wagon door, so all three animals had rushed out after deciding to see what was going on.<br><br>The corn rustled as the strong little dog bounded through.<br><br>The two cats also sped down a row, curiosity raging.<br><br>&#x201c;Selective hearing.&#x201d; Harry shook her head as she followed, starting into a corn row.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, they&#x2019;ll be back. You should stay where you are, otherwise you might destroy footprints or some other kind of evidence.&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped, turned to face her husband. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure you want to see the corpse anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry leaned up against the Volvo. &#x201c;Death really is ugly and this one is probably especially so. But, Fair, why truss someone up like a scarecrow?&#x201d;<br><br>He folded his arms across his chest. &#x201c;Clever, really. How many people passed by this field on Garth Road? Plenty, I bet, and still no one stopped or called the sheriff&#x2019;s department. The only reason we did was because of the ruckus raised by our passengers, and then the crows caught our eye, and . . . well.&#x201d;<br><br>As the married couple waited for the sheriff&#x2019;s department to arrive, the three investigating animals reached the base of the scarecrow.<br><br>A blue-�black crow perched on the straw hat looked down. &#x201c;Beat it!&#x201d; he squawked.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy knew she could climb the dead man&#x2019;s leg if need be, so she stood on her hind legs reaching far up, feeling the cold flesh under the faux scarecrow&#x2019;s pants. &#x201c;I can climb up and shoo all of you away,&#x201d; she threatened the birds.<br><br>A second crow in this mob, on an outstretched arm, gibed, &#x201c;Go ahead. We&#x2019;ll fly away, circle, and come right on back.&#x201d;<br><br>The first crow opened his wings to their full span, the light picking up the blue highlights. &#x201c;What do you want with this feast? Cats don&#x2019;t eat carrion.&#x201d;<br><br>Pewter ignored the question and asked one of her own: &#x201c;Did you see the scarecrow being set up?&#x201d;<br><br>The second crow spoke. &#x201c;No, but he hasn&#x2019;t been here long. We caught a whiff as we flew over this cornfield on our way to Shelford Farm. When we tear off a juicy piece of meat, some blood still drips.&#x201d;<br><br>Few scarecrows are well dressed. Neither was this one. It wore a drab, wrinkled shirt over a red undershirt. Worn, old pants, rope for a belt, took care of his bottom half. Old work boots, the sole separated from the left one, covered his feet. The straw hat, edges frayed, hatband missing, gave the fellow the final country touch.<br><br>As blood pools in the extremities, the crows provided valuable information. The scarecrow wouldn&#x2019;t show the signs of rigor mortis because the body was tied, arms outstretched, legs tied down, too. No blood was moving, the body temperature had cooled down, but this was a fresh kill, relatively.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy noticed that the eyes had been plucked out and a lot of flesh had already been eaten off his face and hands. Eventually, the crows would have torn through the clothing.</p><h2>End Time Delusions: The Rapture, the Antichrist, Israel, and the End of the World</h2><p><p>Will Christians vanish in a rapture? Will seven years of apocalyptic terror overtake those left behind? Will one future Mr. Diabolical - the antichrist - rise to control the world? Will he enter a rebuilt Jewish temple, claiming to be God? Will Earth's nations attack Israel at Armageddon? Best-selling books like Left Behind and popular apocalyptic movies predict such things. Are they correct?</p> <p>No area of Christianity has been subject to more misguided interpretation than prophecy. Millions of Christians sense we are nearing Jesus Christ's return. Yet when it comes to what the majority thinks will happen during Earth's last days, and what the Bible actually says will occur, the difference is seismic.</p> <p>With clarity and biblical accuracy, End Time Delusions exposes massive errors now flooding through media and in much of today's sensational prophecy writing. This book closely examines tightly meshed yet speculative theories about the rapture, seven-year tribulation, antichrist, and the modern Jewish state. This book is no novelty. Buttressed with solid teachings from many of Christianity's most illustrious scholars, it lets the Bible speak for itself about the past, present, and future.</p></p><p>Steve Wohlberg is Speaker/Director of Endtime Insights Radio and TV Ministries.

He is also the author of the fantasy novel <i>Hunt for the Mayan Looking-Glass</i>, available as an eBook.&nbsp;He lives in Annapolis, Maryland, with his wife and youngest child.<i>The first time Han laid eyes on her, standing with Lando on one of Nar Shaddaa&#x2019;s permacrete landing platforms a few short years before he had thrown in with the Rebel Alliance, he saw the battered old freighter not only for all she was but for all that she might one day become.<br></i><br><i>Staring at her like some lovesick cub. Eyes wide, mouth hanging open. Then quickly trying to get hold of himself so that Lando wouldn&#x2019;t know what he was thinking. Dismissing the ship as a hunk of junk. But Lando was no fool, and by then he knew all of Han&#x2019;s tells. One of the best gamblers that side of Coruscant, he knew when he was being bluffed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fast,&#x201d; he had said, a twinkle in his eye. <br></i><br><i>Han didn&#x2019;t doubt it. <br></i><br><i>Even that far back it was easy to envy Lando all he already possessed, his extraordinary good fortune to begin with. But luck had little to do with it. Lando just didn&#x2019;t deserve this ship. He could barely handle a skimmer, let alone a light-fast freighter best flown by a pair of able pilots. He just wasn&#x2019;t worthy of her. <br></i><br><i>Han had never thought of himself as the covetous or acquisitive type, but suddenly he wanted the ship more than he had ever wanted anything in his life. After all the years of servitude and wandering, of close calls and failed partnerships, in and out of love, in and out of the Academy, victim of as many tricks as he&#x2019;d played on others . . . perhaps he saw the ship as a chance for permanence. <br></i><br><i>Circling her, fairly orbiting her, he nursed sinister designs. The old freighter drew him to her gravity, as she clearly had all who had piloted her and added their own touches to the YT&#x2019;s hull, mandibles, the varied techno-terrain of her surface. He took the smell of the ship into his nostrils. </i><br><br><i>The closer he looked, the more evidence he found of attempts to preserve her from the ravages of time and of spaceflight. Dents hammered out, cracks filled with epoxatal, paint smeared over areas of carbon scoring. <br><br>Aftermarket parts socked down with inappropriate fasteners or secured by less-than-professional welds. She was rashed with rust, bandaged with strips of durasteel, leaking grease and other lubricants, smudged with crud. She had seen action, this ship, long before Lando&#x2019;s luck at sabacc had made her his property. But in service to who or what, Han had no idea. Criminals, smugglers, pirates, mercenaries . . . certainly all of those and more. <br></i><br><i>When Lando fired her up for Han&#x2019;s inspection, his heart skipped a beat. And minutes later, seated at the controls, savoring the response of the sublight engines, taking her through the paces and nearly frightening Lando to death, he knew he was fated to own her. He would get the Hutts to buy her for him, or pirate her if he had to. He&#x2019;d add a military-grade rectenna and swap out the light laser cannons for quads. He&#x2019;d plant a retractable repeating blaster in her belly to provide cover fire for quick get�aways. He&#x2019;d install a couple of concussion missile launchers between the boxy forks of her prow . . . <br></i><br><i>Not once did it occur to him that he would win her from Lando. Much less that Lando would lose her on a bluff. </i><br><i>Piloting the modified SoroSuub he and Chewie leased from Lando had only added to his longing for the ship. He imagined her origins and the adventures she had been through. It struck him that he was so accepting of her from the start, he had never asked Lando how or when she had acquired the name </i>Millennium Falcon.<br><b>Corellian Engineering Corporation </b><br><b>Orbital Assembly Facility 7 </b><br><b>60 years Before the Battle of Yavin <br></b><br>WITH HIS SHIFT WINDING DOWN, SOLY KANTT&#x2019;S GAZE DRIFTED lazily between the chrono display mounted on the wall and a news feed running on the HoloNet. A tie score in last night&#x2019;s shock-ball match between Kuat and Commenor, and strife among some spacefaring folk known as Mandalorians. A lanky human with a family on Corellia and ten years on the job, Kantt had his soft hands clasped behind his head and his feet raised with ankles crossed on the console that constituted his private domain at CEC, Orbital 7. A holozine was opened in his lap and a partially filled container of cold caf stood with two empties in the chair&#x2019;s cup holders. Beyond the transparisteel pane that crowned the gleaming monitoring deck moved a steady stream of YT-1300 freighters fresh off the assembly line, though not yet painted, and shepherded by a flock of guidance buoys slaved to the facility&#x2019;s cybernetic overseer. Thirty-five meters long and capable of carrying a hundred metric tons of cargo, the YT had been in production for less than a standard year but had already proved to be an instant classic. Designed with help from Narro Sienar, owner of one of CEC&#x2019;s chief competitors in the shipbuilding business, the freighter was being marketed as an inex�pensive and easily modified alternative to the steadfast YG-series ships. Where most of CEC&#x2019;s starship line was regarded as uninspired, the YT�1300 had a certain utilitarian flair. What made the ship unique was its saucer-shaped core, to which a wide variety of components could be secured, including an outrigger cockpit and various sensor arrays. Stock, it came loaded with a pair of front mandibles that elongated the hull design, and a new generation of droid brain that supervised the ship&#x2019;s powerful sublight and hyperspace engines.<br>Kantt had lost track of just how many YTs had drifted past him since he&#x2019;d traded glances with Facility 7&#x2019;s security scanner eight hours earlier, but the number had to be twice what it was last month. Even so, the ship was selling so quickly that production couldn&#x2019;t keep pace with demand. Setting his feet on the floor, he stretched his arms over his head and was in the midst of a long yawn when the console loosed a strident alarm that jolted him fully awake. His bloodshot eyes were sweeping the deck&#x2019;s numerous display screens when a young tech wearing brightly colored coveralls and a comlink headset hurried in from the adjacent station. <br><br>&#x201c;Control valve on one of the fuel droids!&#x201d; <br><br>Kantt shot to his feet and leaned across the console for a better view of the line. Off to one side, bathed in the bright glow of a bank of illuminators, one of the YTs had a single fuel droid anchored to its port-side nozzle, where up and down the zero-g alley identical droids had already detached from the rest of the freighters. Kantt whirled around. <br><br>&#x201c;Shut the droid down!&#x201d; <br><br>Raised on his toes at a towering control panel, the tech gave his shaved head a shake. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not responding.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Override the fuel program, Bon!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No luck.&#x201d; <br><br>Kantt swung back to the transparisteel pane. The droid hadn&#x2019;t moved and was probably continuing to pump fuel into YT 492727ZED. A form of liquid metal, the fuel that powered the freighters to sometimes dazzling speeds had ignited a controversy from the moment the concept ship had made its appearance. It had nearly been a reason for scuttling the entire line. <br><br>Kantt dropped his gaze to the console&#x2019;s monitor screens and gauges. &#x201c;The YT&#x2019;s fuel cells are at redline. If we can&#x2019;t get that droid to detach before warm-up&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It should be detaching now!&#x201d; <br><br>Kantt all but pressed his face to the cool pane. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s away! But that YT&#x2019;s going to fire hot!&#x201d; Turning, he ran for the door opposite the one Bon had come through. &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d; <br><br>Single-file, they raced through two observation stations. Third in line was the data-keeping department, and Kantt knew from the instant they burst in that things had gone from bad to worse. Clustered at the viewport, the Dralls who staffed the department were hopping up and down in agitation and chittering to one another without letup, despite efforts by the clan&#x2019;s Duchess to restore order. Kantt forced his way through the press of small furry bodies for a look outside. The sit�uation was even worse than he feared. The YT had entered the test area for the braking thrusters and attitude jets. Superfueled, the ship had rocketed out of line, knocking aside and stunning a dozen or more gravitic droids responsible for keeping the line in check. As Kantt watched, three more freighters escaped the line. The YT responsible clipped one of them in the stern, sending it into a forward spin. The spinning ship did the same to the one in front of it, but in counter-rotation, so that when the two ships came full circle they locked mandibles and pirouetted as a pair into the curved inner hull of the ob�servation station on the far side of the alley. <br><br>As the test firing sequence continued, the enlivened YT jinked to port then starboard, leapt out of line, then dived below it. Kantt watched only long enough to know that all thoughts of returning to Corellia in time for dinner were up in smoke. He&#x2019;d be lucky to get home by the weekend. Leaving the Dralls to bicker over how to balance the economic loss, Kantt and the technician stormed into the next station, where a mostly human group of midlevel executives were close to tearing their hair out. To a one, they looked to the newcom�ers for even a scrap of good news. <br><br>&#x201c;A droid team is on the way,&#x201d; Bon said. &#x201c;No problem.&#x201d; <br><br>Kantt gave the tech a quick glance and turned to the execs. &#x201c;You heard him. No problem.&#x201d; <br><br>A red-faced man with shirtsleeves rolled to his elbows glared at him. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think so?&#x201d; His arm shot out, indicating the viewport. &#x201c;See for yourself.&#x201d; <br><br>Kantt hadn&#x2019;t moved a muscle when two others grabbed hold of him and tugged him forward. The droid team had in fact arrived on the scene&#x2013;a quartet of Cybot Galactica grapplers, angling for the bucking YT with clasping arms and waldoes extended. But the freighter was outwitting their every attempt at fastening to the engine access hatches. And though the line had been shut down, well behind 492727ZED a dozen identical units were heaped together where some of the displaced guidance buoys had ended their drift. Worse, the chain reaction of pileups had sent several fuel droids reeling from their respective freighters, and two of them were on a collision course. <br><br>Kantt squeezed his eyes shut, but the hellish flash that stabbed at his eyelids told him part of the story: one or perhaps both of the droids had exploded. His ears told him the rest, as gouts of molten metal and hunks of alloy began to pepper the transparisteel panel. Alarms blared throughout the monitoring stations, and streams of fire-suppression foam gushed into the alley from the semicircular structures that defined it. A collective moan of deep distress filled the room, and Kantt had a mental image of his bonus evaporating before his eyes. With it went the birthday earrings for his wife, his son&#x2019;s game deck, the vaca�tion to Sacorria they&#x2019;d been planning, the case of Gizer ale he was ex�pected to supply for the shock-ball finals party. <br><br>Kantt thought for a moment when he opened his eyes that the nightmare was over, or if not, that the explosion had reduced the unruly YT to blackened parts. But not only had the ship avoided the firestorm and flak, it had also managed to weave through the subsequent chaos and was closing fast on the sublight engine test-fire station. <br>Kantt gave his head a clearing shake and slammed his palm down on the console&#x2019;s communicator button. &#x201c;We need a live crew at Alley Four sublight test fire&#x2013;<i>now!</i>&#x201d; <br><br>Sucking in his breath, he planted his other palm on the console and leaned forward in time to see an emergency sled nose from an up-alley vehicle bay. Little more than an engine surmounted by a cage of vertical and horizontal poles, the sled carried six wranglers outfitted in yellow EVA suits, helmets, and jetpacks. All carried assortments of cut�ting torches, hydrospanners, and shaped-charge detonators that hung from their belts like weapons. Kantt had a friend on the team, who like the rest lived for emergency situations. But a rogue ship was some�thing entirely new. <br>Initially the sled pilot appeared to be having as much trouble matching the YT&#x2019;s maneuvers as the grappler droids had had. The freighter&#x2019;s sudden jukes and twists owed to nothing more than inter�mittent firings of the thrusters and attitude jets, but there were mo�ments when the maneuvers struck Kantt as inspired. As if the ship were taking evasive action or in a race to reach the sublight engine test sta�tion ahead of its more compliant ilk. <br><br>Dire thoughts edged into Kantt&#x2019;s mind of what might happen if the ship couldn&#x2019;t be reined in by then. Would the overfueled YT burn itself to a cinder? Detonate, taking the entire alley with it? Open a vacuum breach in the facility and launch for the stars? <br><br>Gradually, the sled pilot found the rhythm of the firings and was able to bring the skeletal vehicle alongside the YT. Rocketing from the sled, the wranglers alighted on the freighter, anchoring themselves to places on the hull with magclamps and suction holdfasts. Raised up on its stern like some unbroken acklay in a creature show, the YT refused to surrender any of its determination to shake them off. But slow and consistent effort allowed one of the wranglers to reach the dorsal hull access hatch and disappear into the ship. When he did, the execs hooted a cheer Kantt prayed wasn&#x2019;t premature. <br><br>Only when the ship quieted did he realize that he had been holding his breath, and he let it out with a long, plosive exhale, wiping sweat from his brow on the sleeve of his shirt. The cheering gave way to relieved backslapping and rapid exchanges as to how to get the line moving again. With waiting lists for the YT growing longer every day, production would have to be increased. Vacation leaves would have to be canceled. Overtime would become the norm. <br><br>Kantt and Bon didn&#x2019;t linger. <br><br>&#x201c;Born of fire,&#x201d; the tech said as they were passing through the Dralls&#x2019; station. &#x201c;That YT,&#x201d; he added when Kantt glanced at him. &#x201c;A hero&#x2019;s birth if I ever witnessed one. When has that happened?&#x201d; <br><br>Kantt made a face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a freighter, Bon. One of a hundred million.&#x201d; <br><br>Bon grinned. &#x201c;If you ask me, more like one <i>in </i>a hundred million.&#x201d;<br><b>Coruscant </b><br><b>During the battle of Coruscant, </b><br><b>19 years before the battle of Yavin <br></b><br>&#x201c;YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS SHIP,&#x201d; REEZE SAID. &#x201c;She knows her job, all right.&#x201d; <br><br>Jadak slipped the freighter in between a Corellian transport and a Santhe/Sienar passenger ship, then stood YT 492727ZED on her side to ease past the transport and continue to maneuver toward the front of the pack.

This principle sets his plays apart from the rest, steering them clear of melodrama, and draws the audience into the lives of Chekhov&#x2019;s colorful characters. Because of his adherence to realism, the playwright has been called an &#x201c;incomparable artist of life.&#x201d;*<br><br>&#x201c;What makes his work great is that it can be felt and understood not only by any Russian but by anybody in the world.&#x201d;&#x2014;*Leo Tolstoy<br><br>With a Foreword by Robert Brustein&nbsp;and an Afterword by Rosamund Bartlett</p><p><b>Anton Pavlovich Chekhov </b>(1860&#x2013;1904) was born in Taganrog, Russia, on the Sea of Azov, the son of a small shopkeeper and the grandson of a serf. At sixteen, he was left to fend for himself while his father fled with the rest of the family to Moscow, escaping&nbsp;debtors&#x2019; prison. After finishing school in his native town, Chekhov went to Moscow, where, with the aid of a scholarship, he entered the University to study medicine. To help with the family finances, he started publishing tales, anecdotes, jokes, and articles. By the time he took his medical degree in 1884, writing had become his main interest and occupation. His literary reputation grew with the publication of the book <i>Motley Stories</i> (1886). That same year, he made the acquaintance of Alexei Suvorin, owner of the newspaper <i>New Time</i>, who invited him to contribute longer tales at a higher rate. In 1888, he was awarded the Pushkin Prize for the collection <i>In the Twilight</i>. This and the publication of the long story <i>The Steppe</i> marked the beginning of Chekhov&#x2019;s recognition as one of Russia&#x2019;s leading writers. In the years following, he produced his first serious full-length play, <i>Ivanov </i>(1887), as well as a steady stream of short stories. The first production of his famous play <i>The Sea Gull</i> (1896) was a miserable failure. But in 1898, the play was revived at the Moscow Art Theater and proved a resounding success, as did the Theater&#x2019;s productions of <i>The Three Sisters</i> and <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>.

Whether intentional or not, this shift in archival discourse, grounded solidly on 'traditional' archival theory, is more than welcome." - <i>Archivaria</i></p><h2>Telepathy and the Etheric Vehicle</h2><p><p>Occultism is concerned with the scientific facts behind the spiritual idealisms many accept because of a natural human tendency to idealise. One of the most highly idealised concepts is that of the brotherhood of man. Occultism shows that the scientific basis for that ideal rests on the fact of the one etheric structure underlying all forms within the solar system, energised and held in being by one life force. Mankind is, therefore, one in life and in form; he is merely unaware of unity in his own consciousness. And evolution is essentially the means by which he becomes progressively conscious of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. </p> <p><br>In this whole process the faculties of man play an important part--the five objective senses with their five higher spiritual counterparts. The mental principle or faculty is of tremendous importance to humanity at this stage in his evolutionary unfoldment. The three-fold mind unifies as one faculty the higher or abstract mind, the soul--the son of mind, and the lower concrete mind. As this condition of mental fusion and control develops, the disciple is learning to use the mind in new ways, particularly in wielding energy which, as it vitalises and animates his etheric body, influences through radiation his effect on others. </p> <p> <br>It is through this conscious, controlled use of mental energy that telepathic communication can be scientificallv established with other minds by means of the etheric structure common to all. And by the same means the mind of the disciple, or of a group of disciples developing group consciousness, can be impressed by the clarity of thought and purpose of those members of the spiritual Hierarchy concerned with the working out of the Plan for humanity. The spiritual Hierarchy, we are toId, works only through the minds of disciples, using the science of impression, and only for the purposes of the Plan. The impression is conveyed as a stream of ideas--those ideas inherent in the Plan for man--which the disciple or the group can then interpret and translate into self-chosen action. </p> <p><br>The form of telepathy now developing within the spiritually awakened aspirants of the world is not, therefore, that of the solar plexus centre which is of the animal nature, but the result of a mental polarisation and penetration in consciousness towards the soul and the Triad. This produces an open channel of communication in two directions--vertically towards the spiritual Hierarchy of the planet, seeking to impress the Plan on all receptive minds, and horizontally towards the minds of men united within the mental substance of human consciousness as one. </p> <p> <br>The second part of this book discusses the etheric structure of the planet and the solar system of which each man and each form is an integral part; the pattern of the triangle in controlling energy flow and establishing a continuity of circulation through the whole system is of immediate importance to humanity. We are involved in the life of the Planetary Logos--"in Him we live and move and have our being"--and we are a contributing part of the present effort to bring the etheric body under the influence of the soul, symbolised by the triangle. To the extent, and at the rate, that we succeed, so is the planetary etheric structure changing in form to become more consciously integrated into the energy system of which our planet is one small unit. </p> <p><br>So the living process of unity is exemplified--the part contributing to the whole, and the whole effecting the part through every cell and atom of every grade of substance which it contains. </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master,and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.An extract from the Tibetan teacher, written in 1934 briefly explains the intent of these teachings: The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance. They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertain their truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither I nor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspired writing, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being the work of one of the masters. If they present truth in such a way that it follows sequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if the information given raises the aspiration and the will - to - serve from the plane of the emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found) then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth a response from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings a flashing forth of the intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But not otherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemed true under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good. But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said.A&#34; --Lucis Publishing Company</p><h2>Year of the King: An Actor&#39;s Diary and Sketchbook - Twentieth Anniversary Edition</h2><p>In 1984 Antony Sher, hailed as &#x201c;the most exciting actor of his generation&#x201d; by the <i>Observer</i>, made his debut &#x2013; on homemade crutches &#x2013; as the infamous Richard III in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of the play.

God in You, now in popular trade paperback format, is the layperson&#39;s guide to this often-misunderstood member of the Trinity. Pastor David Jeremiah explores the Holy Spirit in concrete terms, leaving abstract concepts behind.

And a clear understanding and appreciation of His attributes can ignite the passion of every Christian&#39;s walk with Christ.

Their fascinating reflections on the relation of the incarnation to other aspects of Christian faith introduce us to depths of truth that most Christians have never dreamed of, let alone explored. Their exposition grows out of the rich tradition of Christian reflection on the incarnation, and it is a joy to see my hero Athanasius and my late mentor T. F.

The authors of this profound study highlight why the incarnation guarantees our salvation, acquaints us with the only Savior we can ever have, allows us to know God, enlivens our obedience, renders the church the bride of Christ, and, not least, informs Christians concerning the logic of God&#x2019;s intention for human sexuality.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Victor A.

A couple other people chip in too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do Patrick and his sister live at the house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Everyone</i> lives at the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, is it nice to come home?&#x201d; asks Jane. &#x201c;Because you get to see the friends you grew up with?&#x201d;</p><p>Jane is fishing, because she&#x2019;s trying to figure out how these servant relationships work, when one person is so rich.</p><p>Kiran doesn&#x2019;t answer right away, just stares straight ahead, her mouth tight, until Jane begins to wonder if her question was rude.</p><p>Then Kiran says, &#x201c;I guess there was a time when seeing Patrick again, after a long absence, made me feel like I was coming home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; says Jane. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not anymore?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eh, it&#x2019;s complicated,&#x201d; Kiran says, with a short sigh. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not talk about it now. He could hear us.&#x201d;</p><p>Patrick would have to have superpowers to hear a word of this conversation, but Jane recognizes a dismissal when she hears one. Peering through the window, she can make out the shapes of other boats, big ones, little ones, vaguely, through the downpour, docked in this tiny bay. Kiran&#x2019;s father, Octavian Thrash IV, owns those boats, this bay, this island off the eastern seaboard, those waving trees, that massive house far above. &#x201c;How will we get to the house?&#x201d; she asks. She can see no road. &#x201c;Will we ascend through the rain, like scuba divers?&#x201d;</p><p>Kiran snorts, then surprises Jane by shooting her a small, approving smile. &#x201c;By car,&#x201d; she says, not elaborating. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve missed the funny way you talk. Your clothes too.&#x201d;</p><p>Jane&#x2019;s gold zigzag shirt and wine-colored corduroys make her look like one of Aunt Magnolia&#x2019;s sea creatures. A maroon clownfish, a coral grouper. Jane supposes she never dresses without thinking of Aunt Magnolia. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;And when&#x2019;s the spring gala?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember,&#x201d; Kiran says. &#x201c;The day after tomorrow? The day after that? It&#x2019;s probably on the weekend.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a gala for every season at Octavian Thrash IV&#x2019;s house on the sea. That&#x2019;s the reason for Kiran&#x2019;s trip. She&#x2019;s come home for the spring gala.</p><p>And this time, for some inexplicable reason, she&#x2019;s invited Jane along, even though, until last week, Jane hadn&#x2019;t seen Kiran since Kiran&#x2019;s graduation almost a year ago. Kiran had stumbled upon Jane at her job in the campus bookshop, because, like many visiting alumni, Kiran had remembered it had a public restroom. Trapped behind the information desk, Jane had seen her coming, an enormous handbag on her arm and a harassed expression on her face. With any other ghost from her past, Jane&#x2019;s first instinct would have been to turn her shoulder, hide behind her dark curls, and make herself into a statue. But the sight of Kiran Thrash brought Jane instantly to the strange promise Aunt Magnolia had extracted from her before she&#x2019;d gone away on that last photography expedition.</p><p>Aunt Magnolia had made Jane promise never to turn down an invitation to Kiran&#x2019;s family estate.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Kiran had said that day, stopping at the desk. &#x201c;Janie. It&#x2019;s you.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d glanced at Jane&#x2019;s arm, where tattooed jellyfish tentacles peeked out from under her shirtsleeve.</p><p>&#x201c;Kiran,&#x201d; said Jane, instinctively touching her arm. The tattoo was new. &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you go to school here now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jane said. &#x201c;I dropped out. I&#x2019;m taking some time. I work here. In the bookstore,&#x201d; she added, which was obvious, and not something she wanted to talk about. But she&#x2019;d learned to chat, to fill the silence with false enthusiasm, and to offer her failures as conversational bait, because sometimes it enabled her to head off the very next question Kiran asked.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your aunt?&#x201d;</p><p>It was like muscle memory now, this steeling herself. &#x201c;She died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Kiran said, narrowing her eyes. &#x201c;No wonder you dropped out.&#x201d;</p><p>It was less friendly, but easier to bear up against, than the usual reaction, because it brought a flare of annoyance into Jane&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;I might have dropped out anyway. I hated it. The other students were snobs and I was failing biology.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Professor Greenhut?&#x201d; Kiran asked, ignoring the dig about snobs.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Known school-wide as a pretentious douche,&#x201d; said Kiran.</p><p>Against her better instincts, Jane smiled. Greenhut assumed his students already knew a lot about biology, and maybe the assumption was just, because no one else in the class had seemed to struggle like Jane had. Aunt Magnolia, who&#x2019;d been an adjunct marine biology teacher, had spluttered over the syllabus. &#x201c;Greenhut&#x2019;s a superior, self-righteous donkey,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said in disgust, then added, &#x201c;No offense to Eeyore. Greenhut is trying to weed out students who didn&#x2019;t go to fancy high schools.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s working,&#x201d; Jane had said.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;ll go to school somewhere else,&#x201d; Kiran said. &#x201c;Somewhere far away. It&#x2019;s healthy to get away from home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Maybe.&#x201d; Jane had always lived in that small, upstate university town, surrounded by students whenever she&#x2019;d stepped outside. Tuition was free for faculty kids. But maybe Kiran was right, maybe Jane should have chosen a different school. A state school, where the other students wouldn&#x2019;t have made her feel so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provincial. These students came from all over the world and they had so much money. Jane&#x2019;s roommate had spent her summer in the French countryside and, once she&#x2019;d learned that Jane had taken high school French, wanted to have conversations in French about towns Jane had never heard of and cheeses she&#x2019;d never eaten.</p><p>How disorienting it had been to attend the classes she&#x2019;d watched enviously through the windows her whole life, and wind up miserable. In the end, she&#x2019;d spent most nights with Aunt Magnolia instead of in her dorm room, feeling like she was living a parallel version of her own life, one that didn&#x2019;t fit her skin. Like she was a puzzle piece from the wrong puzzle.</p><p>&#x201c;You could be an art major somewhere,&#x201d; Kiran said then. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you used to make cool umbrellas?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not art,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re umbrellas. Messy ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Kiran, &#x201c;whatever. Where do you live now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In an apartment in town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same apartment you lived in with your aunt?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;No</i>,&#x201d; Jane said, injecting it with a touch of sarcasm that was probably wasted on Kiran. Of course she hadn&#x2019;t been able to afford that same apartment. &#x201c;I live with three grad students.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you like it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Jane lied. Her apartment-mates were a lot older than she and too pompously focused on their abstruse intellectual pursuits to bother with cooking, or cleaning, or showering. It was like living with self-important Owl from <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i>, except that their hygiene was worse and there were three of them. Jane was hardly ever alone there. Her bedroom was a glorified closet, not conducive to umbrella-making, which required space. It was hard to move around without poking herself on ribs. Sometimes she slept with a work in progress at the end of her bed.</p><p>&#x201c;I liked your aunt,&#x201d; Kiran said. &#x201c;I liked you too,&#x201d; she added, which was when Jane stopped thinking about herself and began to study Kiran, who had changed somehow since she&#x2019;d last seen her. Kiran had used to move as if she were being pushed by at least four different urgent purposes at once.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s brought you to town?&#x201d; Jane asked Kiran.</p><p>Kiran shrugged, listless. &#x201c;I was out driving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you living?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the city apartment.&#x201d;</p><p>The Thrashes&#x2019; city apartment was the top two floors of a Manhattan mansion overlooking Central Park, quite a distance away for someone who was just &#x201c;out driving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Though I&#x2019;ve been called home to the island for the spring gala,&#x201d; Kiran added. &#x201c;And I may stay awhile. Octavian is probably in a mood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Jane, trying to imagine having a gazillionaire father, on a private island, in a mood. &#x201c;I hope you have a nice time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is that tattoo?&#x201d; asked Kiran. &#x201c;Is it a squid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a jellyfish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I see it?&#x201d;</p><p>The jellyfish sat on Jane&#x2019;s upper arm, blue and gold, with thin blue tentacles and spiral arms in white and black reaching all the way down below her elbow. Jane often wore her shirtsleeves rolled up to show a glimpse of the tentacles because, secretly, she liked people to ask to see it. She pushed her sleeve up to the shoulder for Kiran.</p><p>Kiran gazed at the jellyfish with an unchanging expression. &#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Did it hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Jane. And she&#x2019;d taken on an extra job as a waitress at a diner in town for three months to pay for it.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s delicate,&#x201d; said Kiran. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful, actually. Who designed it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s based on a photo my aunt took,&#x201d; said Jane through a flush of pleasure, &#x201c;of a Pacific sea nettle jellyfish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did your aunt ever get to see your tattoo?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Timing can be an asshole,&#x201d; Kiran said. &#x201c;Come get drinks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Jane, startled. &#x201c;Me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After you get off work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m underage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ll buy you a milkshake.&#x201d;</p><p>That night, at the bar, Jane had explained to Kiran what it was like to budget for rent, food, and health insurance on a part-time bookstore salary; how she&#x2019;d sometimes believe in absentminded moments that Aunt Magnolia was just away on another of her photography trips; about the detours she found herself taking to avoid the apartment building where they&#x2019;d lived together. Jane didn&#x2019;t mean to explain it all, but Kiran was from the time when life had made sense. Her presence was confusing. It just came out.</p><p>&#x201c;Quit your job,&#x201d; Kiran said.</p><p>&#x201c;And live how?&#x201d; Jane said, irritated. &#x201c;Not everyone has Daddy&#x2019;s bottomless credit card, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Kiran absorbed the dig with disinterest. &#x201c;You just don&#x2019;t seem very happy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Happy!&#x201d; said Jane, incredulous, then, as Kiran continued to sip her whiskey, seriously annoyed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your job, anyway?&#x201d; she snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you don&#x2019;t exactly seem happy either.&#x201d;</p><p>Kiran surprised Jane by shouting a laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drink to that,&#x201d; she said, then threw back her drink, leaned over the bar, reached into a container of paper umbrellas, and selected one, blue and black to match Jane&#x2019;s shirt and her tattoo tentacles. Opening it carefully, she twirled it between her fingers, then presented it to Jane.</p><p>&#x201c;Protection,&#x201d; Kiran announced.</p><p>&#x201c;From what?&#x201d; Jane asked, examining the umbrella&#x2019;s delicate working interior.</p><p>&#x201c;From bullshit,&#x201d; said Kiran.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Jane said. &#x201c;All this time, I could&#x2019;ve been stopping bullshit with a cocktail umbrella?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It might only work for really small bullshit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Jane, starting to smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, so, I don&#x2019;t have a job,&#x201d; Kiran said again, holding Jane&#x2019;s eyes briefly, then looking away. &#x201c;I apply for things now and then, but it never comes through, and I&#x2019;ll be honest, I&#x2019;m always kind of relieved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem? You have a degree. You had really good grades, didn&#x2019;t you? Don&#x2019;t you speak, like, seven languages?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sound like my mother,&#x201d; said Kiran, her voice more weary than annoyed. &#x201c;And my father, and my brother, and my boyfriend, and every damn person I talk to, ever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was only asking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a spoiled rich girl who has the privilege to mope around, feeling sorry for herself for being unemployed. I get it.&#x201d;</p><p>It was funny, because those were Jane&#x2019;s thoughts exactly. But now, because Kiran had said it, she resented it less. &#x201c;Hello, don&#x2019;t put bullshit in my mouth. I&#x2019;m armed,&#x201d; Jane said, brandishing her cocktail umbrella.</p><p>&#x201c;You know what I liked about your aunt?&#x201d; Kiran said. &#x201c;She always seemed like she knew exactly what she was going to do next. She made you feel like that was possible, to know the right choice.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Yes</i>. Jane tried to respond, but the truth of it caught in her throat. <i>Aunt Magnolia,</i> she thought, choking on it.</p><p>Kiran observed Jane&#x2019;s grief with dispassion.</p><p>&#x201c;Quit your job and come home with me to Tu Reviens,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Stay awhile, as long as you like. Octavian won&#x2019;t mind. Hell, he&#x2019;ll buy your u...</p></p><h2>The Armed Forces of North Korea: On the Path of Songun</h2><p>North Korea&#x2019;s Armed Forces: On the path of Songun seeks to bring order and coherence to the chaotic state of affairs in the intelligence community of North Korea-watchers, as well as to disprove the much-echoed stance that there is little to fear from the DPRK by providing information on a plethora of never-before described weapons systems and modernization programs. <br><br>North Korea&#x2019;s Armed Forces maps the most important events from the inconclusive ceasefire struck at the end of the Korean War, throughout the Cold War until modern day, and an especially heavy emphasis is placed on the current status of the Korean People's Army by examining their wealth of indigenously designed weaponry. In the course of the book not only will many of the Korean People's Army&#x2019;s most secret projects and tactics be unveiled, but also new light will be shed on the deadly flare-ups between the North and the South, and novel evidence on tragic incidents such as the Cheonan sinking and Yeongpyeong bombing of 2010 is brought forth. Moreover, an up-to-date, comprehensive listing of the equipment holdings of several branches of the Korean People's Army is included, offering a numerical assessment of its naval and aerial capabilities. From the recently introduced stealth missile boats, ballistic missile submarines and main battle tank families to their often-ignored indigenous aircraft industry, virtually all indigenous weapons systems are discussed extensively. <br><br>This exclusive content is illustrated by over forty detailed color artworks and various maps put together through exhaustive research and analysis, as well as around 170 unique images, many of which have never before been seen by the general public. Through scrutiny of satellite footage, the observation of North Korean propaganda outlets and by carefully examining information from the United States Department of Defense, the DPRK's advances in each of the Korean People's Army's respective branches are uncovered. Nearly all of the &#x2019;hermit kingdom&#x2019;s&#x2019; military exploits are included and an accurate picture of the North's capabilities in both symmetrical and asymmetrical warfare is provided. This book was written specifically for anyone interested in North Korea's military capabilities or looking to find answers to many questions raised by the minefield of contradictory statements and misinformation that make up current intelligence about this reclusive nation.</p><p>Joost Oliemans is an author, analyst, and blogger focusing on the Middle East, North Africa and Asia.

Linda&#39;s eye for color began with hair and makeup when she owned a beauty salon. Becky has a degree in interior design and has taken many art classes. Their varied backgrounds have combined quite well to make their quilt designs distinctive.This partnership led to the development of 'Piece O' Cake' designs in 1994 and a number of quilting reference books. It has been six years since Becky and Linda last updated The New Applique Sampler and, although their techniques have not changed significantly over the years, more tips and techniques have evolved. I was particularly impressed by the instructions and the very close-up photographs. There are 9 applique blocks to make miniature quilts, 5 new quilt projects which include detailed instructions and full-size pull-out patterns, plus the basic stitches are shown for those who stitch right-handed or left-handed. This is an excellent guide to most types of applique and well worth a place on your reference shelf.

There is absolutely nothing like it currently available. In 1974, legendary "teacher of teachers" yogi Dharma Mittra created the Ultimate Yoga Chart as an offering to his guru, Swami Kailashananda (Yogi Gupta). Setting up a camera in his New York City studio, Dharma Mittra photographed himself in 908 yoga postures, sometimes snapping the picture by holding the trigger between his teeth. He then printed each of the photos as an 8 x 10, and then pasted them together and finally produced a poster of all the postures. The effect is like an Escher drawing: you can&#x2019;t tell what is shown until you get very close, but the picture seems to move and evolve as you watch. Asanas is a stylish, design-driven book that -- for the first time ever -- collects these black and white photogrpahs and provides brief commentary.<br></p><p></p><h2>In the Balance (The Miss Silver Mysteries)</h2><p><b>The &#x201c;marvelous&#x201d; British governess-turned-sleuth helps a new bride who fears her husband intends to murder her (<i>Daily Mail</i>).</b><br><br> Former schoolteacher Miss Maud Silver is on her way back to London when, with a violent shudder of the train, a young woman is thrust into her compartment.

Why would anyone put such eye-catching designs on ships? <br> Desperate to protect ships from German torpedo attacks, British lieutenant-commander Norman Wilkinson proposed what became known as dazzle. These stunning patterns and colors were meant to confuse the enemy about a ship's speed and direction. By the end of the war, more than four thousand ships had been painted with these mesmerizing designs. <br> Author Chris Barton and illustrator Victo Ngai vividly bring to life this little-known story of how the unlikely and the improbable became just plain dazzling.</p></p><p><p><strong>Chris Barton</strong> is the author of acclaimed nonfiction picture books including <em>Dazzle Ships</em>, <em>Whoosh!</em>, <em>What Do You Do with a Voice Like That?</em>, and <em>The Day-Glo Brothers</em>, which was awarded a Sibert Honor.

She's a current nominee for the Hugo, Locus, and Chesley awards.</p><p>"During World War I, the British were in danger of starving because so many German U-boats were sinking American and British supply ships. Eventually, Norman Wilkinson, a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve lieutenant-commander, had the idea to paint boats in such a manner as to confuse the German submarine captains, and the concept of 'dazzle ships' was born. Barton chronicles the creation and implementation of the strategy, including the team of women artists who designed the patterns and the laborers who painted the ships. Readers learn that the wild, striped designs fooled the U-boat captains into thinking the Allies' ships were headed in opposite directions, thus leading to confusion and failed offenses for the Germans. <strong>The well-written, intriguing text is complemented by Ngai's vibrant and surreal illustrations</strong> that skillfully recreate the glittering water and the striking camouflaged vessels. Students will appreciate the information, while taking in the amazing artwork. More material is provided by author's and illustrator's notes at the end. In addition to the back matter, photographs of Wilkinson and one of the dazzle ships are also included. VERDICT <strong>With the commemoration of the centenary of World War I, this book is a fascinating selection that will captivate readers, especially war story enthusiasts.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"During World War I, British and American ships were painted in ways meant to deceive German U-boat crews. Submarine attacks were becoming a problem, and the British and Americans needed a plan to save their ships. Norman Wilkinson of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve came up with a new idea: camouflage. Obviously, they couldn't make the ships invisible, but maybe they could paint them in a way that would confuse submarine officers and make it difficult to determine which way a ship was heading and how fast&#x2015;important since torpedoes were fired not at the ship but at the spot where the ship would soon be. In 1917, ships were 'dazzle-painted,' or painted in 'crazy' designs meant to confuse. Ngai uses analog and digital media to great effect, from the dazzling cover (which will attract many readers all by itself) to the range of designs employed, applying an appropriate period aesthetic throughout. Readers, however, may not quite see the genius, since, in most illustrations, it's pretty clear which direction the ships are heading, and the perspective from German periscopes is lacking. And, by war's end, the Royal Navy couldn't prove that dazzle had spared any ships, which may sink enthusiasm for the story. Still, it's <strong>a fascinating volume about a little-known side of the war. An eye-catching title sure to dazzle.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"'One of the ships on this page is painted in sneaky, stripy camouflage. You probably can't even see it. Oh. You can see it? Hmmmmmmm.' </p> <p>"The striped ship, depicted in bright blues and yellows, is a World War I Allied vessel. In 1917, the Central Powers began attacking Allied non-fighting ships; the plan was to cut off Britain and win the war by starving the island nation. Desperate to feed its people, Britain tried 'different things to stop the submarine attacks': there was discussion of training seagulls and sea lions and sending swimmers to smash periscopes. Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve lieutenant-commander Norman Wilkinson was the most well-known of those who floated the idea to camouflage ships. He said, 'since it was impossible to paint a ship so that she could not be seen by a submarine, the extreme opposite was the answer&#x2015;to paint her, not for low visibility, but in such a way as to break up her form and thus confuse a submarine officer as to the course on which she was heading.' And so the 'dazzle ship' was born. </p> <p> "More than 3,000 U.S. and British ships were painted with the crazy-looking patterns. If the Germans were confused, their U-boats would launch torpedoes in error&#x2015;the Allies hoped&#x2015;and valuable resources would be wasted while Allied ships were kept safe. In both Great Britain and the United States, young female artists helped to create the designs, first on wooden models, then on paper and finally painted onto the ships themselves. In the U.S., members of the Women's Reserve Camouflage Corps 'even used dazzle to draw attention to a ship-shaped New York City naval recruiting station.'</p> <p> "Germany surrendered in November 1918 and the United States declared 'that dazzle kept lots of ships from getting sunk.' But 'Britain wasn't so sure. The Royal Navy couldn't prove that dazzle had actually spared any ships.' Effective or not, it was noted that many sailors felt safer knowing that something had at least been attempted to keep them alive. And the story of dazzle ships is a remarkable one. </p> <p> "As developed for children by author Chris Barton (<em>Whoosh!</em>), this story shows that 'sometimes desperate times call for dazzling measures'; ingenuity is important, especially in the most trying of times. Paired with Barton's welcoming language and accessible story, Victo Ngai's illustrations sparkle. Using mixed analogue and digital media, she re-creates historical map templates and incorporates her own dazzle, creating overlapping and interconnecting patterns with strong lines and bright colors. Ngai's illustrations are inviting, drawing the reader in and slowing the pace of the narrative, each double-page spread an abundance of color and texture and shape, demanding time and reflection. </p> <p> "<em>Dazzle Ships</em> shines and shows that 'a willingness to tackle problems by trying the unlikely, the improbable, the seemingly bonkers will always be needed.'</p> <p> "Shelf Talker: <strong>Chris Barton and Victo Ngai's <em>Dazzle Ships</em> gives young readers an introduction to World War I in a clever and colorful way.</strong>"</p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"It might seem counterintuitive to paint bold, eye-catching patterns on ships aiming to pass safely through U-boat-infested waters, but as Barton and Ngai's informative picture book demonstrates, that unconventional choice was a daring stroke of genius. During WWI, Britain's warships were routinely targeted by German U-boats, and the Royal Navy was desperate for a way to avoid Germany's attacks. Norman Wilkinson's groundbreaking patterns&#x2015;not quite camouflage, but painting the ships in a way that makes their movements hard to detect&#x2015;fooled even the most experienced sailors, and the navy employed cadres of art students to design more dazzles. Ngai's swirling, art nouveau&#x2013;style illustrations replicate some of the bold shapes and designs on the so-called 'dazzle ships,' and the soft colors and stylized figures nicely soften the wartime theme and focus attention to the ships. Barton adds plenty of historical context, illuminating other naval defense schemes of the period, as well as the role of women in creating dazzle patterns. An author's note, time line, and photos of the ships round out this <strong>inspiring story of creativity.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Dazzling in their own right, newcomer Ngai's illustrations strikingly depict the dazzle ships of WWI, more than 4,000 British and U.S. merchant and warships that were painted with wild colors and patterns. These 'dazzle' designs, explains Barton (<em>88 Instruments</em>), 'were supposed to confuse German submarine crews about the ships' direction and speed' and keep them safer from torpedo fire. Ngai runs with the camouflage theme in energetic scenes that are crisscrossed with geometric and organic patterns and lines: in one spread, the uniform jacket of British naval officer Norman Wilkinson, who proposed the dazzle painting idea, is masked by the curvilinear patterns and hues of the ocean waves in the background. 'Sometimes desperate times call for dazzling measures,' writes Barton in conclusion, underscoring the importance of creative problem solving. Reflective author and artist notes, a timeline with b&amp;w photographs, and a reading list wrap up <strong>a conversational, compelling, and visually arresting story</strong> that coincides with the 100th anniversary of its subject."&#x2015;starred, <em>Publishers Weekly</em> </p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"A German U-boat raises its periscopes, sights a target vessel, and launches a torpedo timed to explode just as the ship crosses its trajectory. It's hard to defend against, and as of early 1917, Britain is in serious trouble; in fact, U-boat decimation of food-carrying merchant ships threatens starvation if the tide doesn't turn. In desperation, odd tactics, such as trained sea lions doing reconnaissance and swimmers smashing periscopes, are suggested. Norman Wilkinson, an officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, comes up with an idea for camouflage&#x2015;not to paint British ships the color of sea or sky, but to cover them in patterns so distracting, so visually disruptive, that the U-boat won't be able to tell how fast or in which direction its prey is sailing. The technique became known as 'dazzle,' and by war's end over 1,200 American and 3,000 British ships were designed and painted by a corps of workers, many of them women. 'So just how well did dazzle work? Nobody really knows,' Barton admits. There's no denying, however, that dazzle boosted morale and makes a heckuva great story. <strong>Barton's lively text is matched by Ngai's engrossing artwork, which employs dazzle techniques throughout her inventive spreads.</strong> Contrasting colors, unexpected curves, eccentrically layered design elements, and cleverly deployed chiaroscuro walk the line between instructive playfulness and an art deco fever dream.

Or that Sam Cooke was shot dead in a seedy motel after barging into the manager's office naked to attack her? Maybe not. Would it change your view of him if you knew that, or would your love for his music triumph?</i><br> <br>Real rock stars do truly insane thing and invite truly insane things to happen to them; murder, drug trafficking, rape, cannibalism and the occult. We allow this behavior. We are complicit because a rock star behaving badly is what's expected. It's baked into the cake. Deep down, way down, past all of our self-righteous notions of justice and right and wrong, when it comes down to it, we want our rock stars to be bad. We know the music industry is full of demons, ones that drove Elvis Presley, Phil Spector, Sid Vicious and that consumed the Norwegian Black Metal scene. We want to believe in the myths because they're so damn entertaining.<br><br>DISGRACELAND is a collection of the best of these stories about some of the music world's most beloved stars and their crimes. It will mix all-new, untold stories with expanded stories from the first two seasons of the Disgraceland podcast. Using figures we already recognize, DISGRACELAND shines a light into the dark corners of their fame revealing the fine line that separates heroes and villains as well as the danger Americans seek out in their news cycles, tabloids, reality shows and soap operas. At the center of this collection of stories is the ever-fascinating music industry--a glittery stage populated by gangsters, drug dealers, pimps, groupies with violence, scandal and pure unadulterated rock 'n' roll entertainment.<br><br><b><b><b> </b></b></b></p><p>Jake Brennan is a Boston based musician who launched, Disgraceland, &#34;a rock &#39;n&#39; roll true crime podcast&#34; in February 2018 to great acclaim.

Translating that principle into methods of guiding care at the end of life, however, can be a complicated and daunting task. Dignity therapy, a psychological intervention developed by Dr. Harvey Max Chochinov and his internationally lauded research group, has been designed specifically to address many of the psychological, existential, and spiritual challenges that patients and their families face as they grapple with the reality of life drawing to a close. Tested with patients with advanced illnesses in Canada, the United States, Australia, China, Scotland, England, and Denmark, dignity therapy has been shown to not only benefit patients, but their families as well. <br><br>In the first book to lay out the blueprint for this unique and meaningful intervention, Chochinov addresses one of the most important dimensions of being human. Being alive means being vulnerable and mortal; he argues that dignity therapy offers a way to preserve meaning and hope for patients approaching death. <br><br><em>Dignity Therapy: Final Words for Final Days</em> is a beautiful introduction to this pioneering and innovative work. With history and foundations of dignity in care, and step by step guidance for readers interested in implementing the program, this volume illuminates how dignity therapy can change end-of-life experience for those about to die - and for those who will grieve their passing.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dr. Harvey Max Chochinov</strong> is an international leader in palliative care. He is Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Manitoba and Director of the Manitoba Palliative Care Research Unit at CancerCare Manitoba. His seminal publications on psychosocial issues in advanced illness have helped define core competences and standards of palliative end-of-life care.<br><br>Dr. Chochinov has been a guest lecturer in many major academic institutions around the world. He has been lauded for his contributions to palliative care, with awards and recognitions coming from the Canadian Medical Association, the International Psycho-oncology Society, the Canadian Cancer Society, the Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology, the Canadian Psychiatric Association, the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine, and the American Association of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. He is Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. In 2014 he was inducted as an Officer in the Order of Canada.<br><br>"This is truly a remarkable book-- it simultaneously brings together the best we know of the science of palliative care with the essence and best of compassionate care." -- <em>Jimmie C. Holland, Wayne E. Chapman Chair in Psychiatric Oncology and Attending Psychiatrist, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer</em> <em>Center</em> <br><p></p><br>"For all health professionals who find themselves struggling to help patients face the complex process of dying, this book is both a detailed roadmap and an extraordinary guide that dispels the myth that 'there is nothing else they can do.' Embodying the essence of professionalism and caring, this text describes an innovative, evidence-based, therapeutic intervention to address the psychological and existential distress of patients with serious life threatening illnesses. Most importantly, the book sets a high standard for creating an environment that enables patients' exploration of personhood and suffering and enhances their dignity in the final days of their lives." -- <em>Kathleen M. Foley, Attending Neurologist, Pain and Palliative Care Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"People often ask how palliative care clinicians can do this work day in, day out. I struggle to articulate the profound experience of witnessing patients and families find meaning and transcendence through their illness, but now I will refer them to Dr. Chochinov's remarkable book. He not only relays story after story of such healing, but he also gives us all clear guidance to help our patients and their families to make meaning of their lives in a consistent and standardized manner. Because it will help us to better help our patients and their families, his work is a gift to palliative care clinicians everywhere." -- <em>Diane E. Meier, Director, Center to Advance Palliative Care; Director, Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute; and Professor of Geriatrics and Internal Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Chochinov has pioneered the work of dignity therapy, and through his scholarship, the field of palliative care has been deeply influenced. <em>Dignity Therapy</em> is a rich blend of a deep understanding of the existential concerns of the seriously ill and dying, and an incredibly practical resource for clinicians." -- <em>Betty Ferrell, Professor and Research Scientist, City of Hope Medical Center</em> <br><p></p><br>"Without careful characterization, concepts like dignity are ephemeral and profoundly difficult to address in a therapeutic paradigm. In <em>Dignity Therapy: Final Words for Final Days</em>, Harvey Chochinov brings clarity to the factors that influence the dignity of seriously and terminally ill persons. He expounds upon a well-developed and pragmatic therapeutic approach that has already been of help to thousands of patients across the world. This is not your usual medical text-- it is written with profound sensitivity, humanity, and wisdom that is both inspiring and practical." -- <em>Nathan I. Cherny,</em> <em>Norman Levan Chair in Humanistic Medicine and Director of Cancer Pain and Palliative Care Service, Department of Oncology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this elegant book, Harvey Chochinov shows how the interrelatedness of one human being with another affects an individual's intrinsic sense of dignity, and he examines the implications of this on the care environment. Every palliative care service will find this book enriching and will look with refreshed eyes on the work of providing care to others." <br>-- <em>Baroness Ilora Finlay of Llandaff, Professor of Palliative Medicine, Cardiff University, and Member, House of Lords, UK</em> <br><p></p><br>"As a clinical psychologist and hospice professional, I have always been an advocate of offering therapy and support to individuals as they face dying. The book <em>Dignity Therapy</em> offers unique insight into the process of psychological dying and the opportunity for growth. I recommend it to anyone who is working in the helping professions and has the unique opportunity to be present as individuals create their own last chapter." -- <em>J. Donald Schumacher, President and CEO, National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization</em> <br><p></p><br>"Dying patients fear the loss of dignity at the end of their lives. Dr. Chochinov's book guides medical staff, patients, and families along a path where the patient is empowered, the family can be comforted, and the medical staff can truly provide for every aspect of its patient's needs." -- <em>Sharon</em> <em>Carstairs, Senator for Manitoba, Canada</em> <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Chochinov is a pioneer of a new direction in psychiatry. Starting from first principles, he has defined dignity and developed an approach to its restoration in patients with far advanced disease. We have adopted it, clinically, in our own center. Our staff says it has added a new effective tool in caring for patients and their families. There's no better accolade for a physician than to have moved the field forward in the eyes of its clinicians." <br>-- <em>Charles F. von Gunten, Provost, Institute for Palliative Medicine at San Diego Hospice</em> <br><p></p><br>"Harvey Chochinov is a world leading clinician scientist who has spent the last 20 years improving our understanding of the concerns of patients and their families dealing with life limiting illnesses and facing the end of life. Dignity is at the heart of all we do in health care. This book is valuable to clinicians from all settings and fields, those involved in medical and nursing education, and those undertaking research to improve patient and family experience and care." -- <em>Irene J. Higginson, Professor of Palliative Care, King's College, London</em> <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Chochinov's <em>Dignity Therapy</em> provides a practical way to implement one of the essential elements of any healthcare system and any relationship between a clinician or caregiver and patient who is seriously ill-- honoring the dignity of each and every individual. His book provides practical, evidence-based, yet sacred, interventions that allow for healing in the midst of suffering. Dr. Chochinov inspires all of us to transform our systems of care so that all people can find meaning, purpose, and value in their lives." -- <em>Christina M. Puchalski, Professor of Medicine and Health Sciences,</em> <em>and Director, The George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health (GWish) , The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Reading his latest book challenged me to look at his expanded work in <em>Dignity Therapy</em> to consider additional ways to engage with palliative care patients. Whether you are a professional who, like me, works in palliative care or in another setting, I recommend Chochinov's book as one to put on your reading list for the coming year." -- <em>Plain Views</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Dignity Therapy: Final Words for Final Days</em> is an inspiring work that introduces the innovative work of Harvey Chochinov on maintaining dignity in individuals approaching death. It is an engaging read distinguished by its depth of insight and vibrant perspective.... On completing the book, I felt that I had grown in the ability to help others find meaning and solace in the final chapter of life." -- <em>Andrew R. Barnosky, DO, MPH, JAMA</em><p></p><br>"There is much of value in Chochinov's thoughtful and careful work... [O]ne of the unquestionable merits of this work is the sincerity, sensitivity, and authenticity with which the author grapples with the possible difficulties that might arrise in each step of the therapeutic process. Clearly, for palliative care agencies and workers who are considering the possibility of utilizing dignitiy therapy with their patients, this is an essential text." --<em>The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"<em>Dignity Therapy: Final Words for Final Days</em> is a comprehensive, well-written, and engaging book, which provides a clear background and implementation guide for Dignity Therapy. It would probably be most useful for palliative care and hospice providers and for those of us in palliative care who are in a position to either implement or advocate for the implementation of a Dignity Therapy program." -- <em>Mercedes Pacheco, Journal of Palliative Medicine</em><p></p><br>"What I like about it particularly is that it presents a subtle and powerful argument against euthanasia without in any way being overtly religious." -- <em>Francis Phillips, Catholic Herald</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Composing Electronic Music: A New Aesthetic</h2><p>Electronic music evokes new sensations, feelings, and thoughts in both composers and listeners. Opening the door to an unlimited universe of sound, it engages spatialization as an integral aspect of composition and focuses on sound transformation as a core structural strategy. In this new domain, pitch occurs as a flowing and ephemeral substance that can be bent, modulated, or dissolved into noise. Similarly, time occurs not merely as a fixed duration subdivided by ratios, but as a plastic medium that can be generated, modulated, reversed, warped, scrambled, and granulated. Envelope and waveform undulations on all time scales interweave to generate form. The power of algorithmic methods amplify the capabilities of music technology. Taken together, these constitute game-changing possibilities. <br><br>This convergence of technical and aesthetic trends prompts the need for a new text focused on the opportunities of a sound oriented, multiscale approach to composition of electronic music. Sound oriented means a practice that takes place in the presence of sound. Multiscale means an approach that takes into account the perceptual and physical reality of multiple, interacting time scales-each of which can be composed. After more than a century of research and development, now is an appropriate moment to step back and reevaluate all that has changed under the ground of artistic practice.<br><br><em>Composing Electronic Music</em> outlines a new theory of composition based on the toolkit of electronic music techniques. The theory consists of a framework of concepts and a vocabulary of terms describing musical materials, their transformation, and their organization. Central to this discourse is the notion of narrative structure in composition-how sounds are born, interact, transform, and die. It presents a guidebook: a tour of facts, history, commentary, opinions, and pointers to interesting ideas and new possibilities to consider and explore.<br></p><p><br><strong>Curtis Roads</strong> is an award-winning composer and researcher who teaches electronic music composition at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He co-founded the International Computer Music Association and served as an editor/associate editor of <em>Computer Music Journal</em> for 23 years. The author of numerous books, his electronic music set POINT LINE CLOUD won the Award of Distinction at the 2002 Ars Electronica.<br><br>"a worthwhile addition to electronic music literature." -- Richard Barrett, <em>Journal of Sonic Studies</em><p></p><br>"Clearly formulated starting points engage the reader in more challenging concepts and interesting lines of enquiry, contextualising the many perspectives surrounding each topic. This well researched treasure chest of quotes, references, and examples illustrates an insightful text which the author, himself with decades of experience as a transcontinental practitioner, has enriched with personal reflections that in turn allow the reader to do the same."-Natasha Barrett <br><p></p><br>Curtis Roads' book is a kind of prism that reevaluates the field of music composition in the light of the new technologies of the 21st century. He builds a thousand bridges between different approaches to attributes like pitch, rhythm, time scales, and even sonic narratives in order to help us to understand present music practices." -Horacio Vaggione, composer, Professor Emeritus, the University of Paris VIII<p></p><br>"A rich and enjoyable survey for the computer musician, ranging from the objects of compositional manipulation to the performative aspects of the shaping of sensory experience. This book will be of interest not only to the electronic music composer, but also to the performing musician, and the general reader interested in the process and principles of musical design." -Elaine Chew, Professor of Digital Media, Queen Mary University of London<p></p><br>"[I]f you want a great overview of just about any aspect of the field of electronic music, you'll find it in this book. Clearly written, with a minimum of mathematics, it's the kind of book you can refer to time and time again."--<em>SoundBytes</em><p></p><br>"Time is passing, and when I came back to Paris, I read [the] wonderful book <em>Composing </em><br>Electronic Music : A New Aesthetic. Congratulations! It is a great book! I totally agree with the main thesis of this book, clarifying that electronic music has been opening a new full area on the history of music, and putting a clear separation between the area of 'acoustic' music, and the area of 'electronic' music. What a pleasure to read a book which explains to us all the foundations of electronic music, all of its researchs, its true history, etc...I hope that [the] book is going to be translated in French, because the French music situation needs it absolutely!" -- Jean-Claude Eloy, French composer of instrumental, vocal and electroacoustic music <br><p></p><br>"The text does have the primary motivational benefit that at many moments it makes the reader want to go and compose. Aside from the joy of crafting pure sound at many structural levels, it provokes new organizational ideas in reaction to theory."--<em>Music and Letters</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Shoah</h2><p>A nine-and-a-half-hour documentary on the Nazi extermination camps, <i>Shoah</i> (the Hebrew word for "Holocaust") was internationally hailed as a masterpiece upon its release in 1985. Shunning any re-creation, archival footage, or visual documentation of the events, filmmaker Claude Lanzmann relied on the words of witnesses&#x2014;Jewish, Polish, and German&#x2014;to describe in ruthless detail the bureaucratic machinery of the Final Solution, so that the remote experiences of the Holocaust became fresh and immediate. This book presents in an accessible and vivid format the testimony of survivors, participants, witnesses, and scholars.

In <em>Family Vocation</em>, Veith and Moerbe have really hit the mark&#x2015;we must learn to think of marriage and families as vocations from God. Here is an ancient and sacred vision of marriage and family that we would do well to understand, promote, and most importantly live out.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Charles Colson</strong>, Founder, Prison Fellowship and the Colson Center for Christian Worldview</p><p>&#x201c;A great president once referred to the family as the &#x2018;unseen pillar of civilization.&#x2019; He was right, and so is Gene Veith in this luminous book, which underscores the centrality of family, marriage, and parenting. Timely and absorbing, this book arrives on the scene at exactly the right time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim Goeglein</strong>, Vice President, Focus on the Family</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Family Vocation</em> is a thorough and thoughtful look at family as a calling from God. Using Martin Luther&#x2019;s teaching on family living as a starting point, Gene Veith and his daughter Mary Moerbe have produced a foundational book addressing all the callings of family life. In a marketplace in which so many family books only scratch the surface, <em>Family Vocation</em> digs down deep. The things I look for in a book on family are all here: a focus on nurture, the priority of internal change, and the power of grace and the gospel to enable. A worthy read!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tedd Tripp,</strong>&nbsp;pastor; international conference speaker; author, <em>Shepherding a Child's Heart</em></p><p>&#x201c;The phrase &#x2018;gospel-centered&#x2019; has become almost a clich� when describing Christian writing. Every Christian author would desire such an epitaph for his or her work. However, in so many books, especially those dealing with family, gospel-centered deteriorates into &#x2018;be like Jesus.&#x2019; <em>Family Vocation</em> is the epitome of what gospel-centered truly means. The authors introduce it plainly, &#x2018;The gospel&#x2015;that is, the message of Christ crucified for sinners&#x2015;relates to every moment of the believer&#x2019;s life.&#x2019; Every chapter has its foundation, built not upon what we do in our various vocations, but upon what God has done in Christ. This approach to vocation is the means through which Christian families can truly be strengthened and restored, and then bring their influence to bear on our culture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>James I. Lamb</strong>, Executive Director, Lutherans for Life</p><p>&#x201c;The ageless questions we&#x2019;ve pondered about marriage, divorce, sexuality, and parenting are asked candidly and answered faithfully by Veith and Moerbe in this timely application of Luther&#x2019;s doctrine of vocation. The word <em>family</em> has been hijacked by our culture and Christians reel with each new and dysfunctional incarnation of the concept. What <em>is</em> family? What <em>is</em> marriage? What <em>is</em> God&#x2019;s call to be a husband, wife, parent, or child? The authors offer rich, biblical responses to these questions and bring clarity to our understanding about cross-bearing love and sacrifice. <em>Family Vocation</em> is sure to find a home on the desks of pastors, teachers, and counselors who seek an engaging resource for Bible classes, spiritual care conversations, and godly counsel. This book leads the way to abiding grace and hope in God&#x2019;s promises&#x2015;a &#x2018;need-to-read&#x2019; for Christian husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Beverly K. Yahnke</strong>, Department Chair of Social Sciences, Concordia University Wisconsin</p><p>&#x201c;Martin Luther identified marriage and family as one of three fundamental estates of human life instituted by God for the good of his creation. In this book, a father and daughter team up to bring Luther&#x2019;s rich insights into the twenty-first century in a way that challenges and encourages Christians to see the family as the arena for God&#x2019;s work. In an age when the fabric of the family is strained by cultural forces of self-interest and hedonism, this book suggests a way forward for Christian families to see life together as husband/wife, parent/child&#x2015;encompassed in vocation lived out under the cross.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John T. Pless</strong>, Assistant Professor of Pastoral Ministry and Missions, Concordia Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;In the church today, there is no more significant issue than the family. This divine institution is in the crosshairs of every evil plan and purpose of the Devil himself. Take down the family, and with it go education, order, decency, law, church, and even faith. How my years in a struggling inner-city parish taught me that the gospel does not thrive in a community of chaos, dilapidation, crime, and disorder! The root cause of it, as I came to be convinced, is institutional and spiritual forces attacking the stability of God&#x2019;s best agent for good in both the kingdom of the civil realm and that of the church&#x2015;the family. What was once more commonly an urban reality has become a rural and suburban way of life.

Samuel Walker analyzes the reasons behind President Truman's most controversial decision. Delineating what was known and not known by American leaders at the time, Walker evaluates the options available for ending the war with Japan. In this new edition, Walker incorporates a decade of new research--mostly from Japanese archives only recently made available--that provides fresh insight on the strategic considerations that led to dropping the bomb. From the debate about whether to invade or continue the conventional bombing of Japan to Tokyo's agonizing deliberations over surrender and the effects of both low- and high-level radiation exposure, Walker continues to shed light on one of the most earthshaking moments in history. <br><br>Rising above an often polemical debate, the third edition presents an accessible synthesis of previous work and new research to help make sense of the events that ushered in the atomic age.<br><br></p><p>J.

You have such a book in this English translation of Father Heinrich Denzinger&#39;s Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum. Since it was first published a century and a half ago, this handbook or collection (enchiridion) of articles (symbols) of faith and morals has enjoyed universal appeal and approbation since the pontificate of Blessed Pope Pius IX. The Enchiridion has been updated periodically; the edition being offered here by Loreto is that issued in 1957. The collection includes all articles and creeds of the Catholic Faith beginning with that of the twelve apostles, all dogmatic definitions stamped with the Petrine authority of the apostolic See (ex cathedra), decrees of the solemn magisterium, papal bulls, encyclicals and letters, as well as some of the more weighty decisions of the Holy Office prior to 1957. Although not every entry in this 653 page compendium of Church teaching is definitional (i.e. ex cathedra) it still should be considered the &#34;locutus est&#34; for every wayfaring Catholic whose patria, this side of heaven, is Roma. In addition to a general index there is a scriptural index plus an invaluable systematic or topical index making for very easy reference. Note, too, this edition comes with a one page Corrigenda which is a list of sixteen corrections that must be applied to errors (usually omissions) that escaped the eyes of editors in previous editions.</p><p></p><h2>The Harmony of Bill Evans</h2><p>(Keyboard Instruction).

Mike and Rosie are now the co-heads of the Felony Division, where they spend more time running the office and supervising younger attorneys than trying cases. That changes quickly when Mike is visited by Melinda Nguyen, whose son, Thomas, a high school senior, is about to go on trial for murder. Thomas has been arrested under California&#x2019;s archaic &#x201c;felony murder rule,&#x201d; which says you can be can be convicted of first degree murder if you&#x2019;re present when someone is killed during the course of a felony, even if you don&#x2019;t pull the trigger. The charge against Thomas shows the absurd limits of this legal doctrine. He was sitting outside in the car when a friend entered a liquor store in San Francisco&#x2019;s teeming Tenderloin District and allegedly flashed a gun. The shopkeeper pulled out an AR-15 and calmly filled the alleged robber&#x2019;s chest with bullets. Thomas is charged with murder even though he never entered the store. Thomas fires his original lawyer on the eve of trial after she recommends acceptance of a plea bargain. With nowhere else to turn, his mother petitions for help from the Public Defender&#x2019;s Office, and Mike agrees to handle the trial scheduled to start four days later. As the evidence mounts against Thomas, it tests Mike and Rosie&#x2019;s legal skills and relationship. Their stress is compounded by the fact that Thomas and his mother may have a connection to Mike&#x2019;s older brother, Tommy, who died in Vietnam forty years earlier. Aided by Mike&#x2019;s brother, Pete, a private investigator, and Rosie&#x2019;s niece, Rolanda, a top-notch young attorney at the P.D.&#x2019;s Office, Mike and Rosie face their most compelling challenge yet as they race to represent their client and try to find closure for old wounds. An intricate plot, immensely likeable characters, powerful suspense, and a touch of humor are Sheldon Siegel&#x2019;s hallmarks. In Felony Murder Rule, readers will discover once again why reviewers have called Mike Daley and Rosie Fernandez two of the most compelling and beloved characters in contemporary crime fiction.</p><p>Sheldon Siegel is the New York Times, USA Today and #1 Amazon Bestselling Author of the Mike Daley/Rosie Fernandez series of critically acclaimed courtroom dramas featuring San Francisco criminal defense attorneys Mike Daley and Rosie Fernandez.

Ruggieri's <i>Confessions of a Surgeon</i>,<i> </i>and Atul Gawande's <i>Better,</i>&nbsp;a pioneering surgeon shares memories from a life in one of surgery&#x2019;s most demanding fields</b><br><br> The 1980s marked a revolution in the field of organ transplants, and Bud Shaw, M.D., who studied under Tom Starzl in Pittsburgh, was on the front lines. Now retired from active practice, Dr. Shaw relays gripping moments of anguish and elation, frustration and reward, despair and hope in his struggle to save patients. He reveals harshly intimate moments of his medical career: telling a patient's husband that his wife has died during surgery; struggling to complete a twenty-hour operation as mental and physical exhaustion inch closer and closer; and flying to retrieve a donor organ while the patient waits in the operating room. Within these more emotionally charged vignettes are quieter ones, too, like growing up in rural Ohio, and being awakened late at night by footsteps in the hall as his father, also a surgeon, slipped out of the house to attend to a patient in the ER.<br><br> In the tradition of Mary Roach, Jerome Groopman, Eric Topol, and Atul Gawande,&nbsp;<i>Last Night in the OR </i>is an exhilarating, fast-paced, and beautifully written memoir,<i>&nbsp;</i>one that&nbsp;will captivate readers with its courage, intimacy, and honesty.</p><p><b>Bud Shaw </b>grew up the oldest child of a general surgeon in rural south central Ohio. He graduated with an AB in Chemistry from Kenyon College in 1972 and received his MD degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1976. In 1981, he completed a surgery residency at the University of Utah, then trained in Pittsburgh under Tom Starzl, the father of liver transplantation. An internationally renowned transplant surgeon by age 35, Shaw left Pittsburgh in 1985 to start a new transplant program in Nebraska that quickly became one of the most respected transplant centers in the world. An author of 300 journal articles, 50 book chapters, and a founding editor of the prestigious journal, <i>Liver Transplantation</i>, he retired from active practice and the department chairmanship in 2009, and now focuses on writing, teaching and the value of narrative studies in medical education and clinical practice. His prize-winning essay, <i>My Night With Ellen Hutchinson</i>, published in <i>Creative Nonfiction Magazine</i>, was nominated for a 2013 Pushcart Prize and received Special Mention. The father of three adult children, Shaw lives with his wife, novelist Rebecca Rotert (Shaw) in the wooded hills north of Omaha, Nebraska.<p></p><p>Photo by Rebecca Shaw</p><p></p><p></p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p><p>We can&#x2019;t know, let alone remember all the people whose presence shapes what we become. At least I can&#x2019;t, and that&#x2019;s my excuse for failing to recognize all of those I&#x2019;ll now leave out, from the teachers who wouldn&#x2019;t let me get away with mediocrity and the guys who plucked my nineteen-year-old hitchhiking self from the freeway one frigid midnight and spent the next eighty miles trying to convince me to become gay, to the few teachers who worked so diligently at making students feel small and useless and the many more whose patience and faith often felt undeserved yet no less inspiring. They all played a role. That said, I want to recognize a few, not necessarily because they are most important, but because of their persistence.</p><p>When I was six years old, my mother made writing stories a work of joy and pride. I discovered an alternate world, one in which I had complete control. Her untimely death changed all worlds forever, infusing a reality I spent decades denying, no matter how real it became. My father taught me to be my own worst critic, from a similarly early age, less with his words than with the intangible signs of his joy and disappointment. He was also my hero, in so many wonderful ways. I miss him horribly.</p><p>Until Mr. Leonard Gwizdowski gave me my first C grade in fifth grade, I&#x2019;d never received less than an A on anything. My mother was outraged with him, but Gwizzy stood his ground and I had to learn to study&#x2014;really study. Six years later, Mrs. Mildred Veler gave me a required reading list separate from the other students&#x2019;. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lazy,&#x201d; she said, and told me to start with Joyce. At Kenyon College, William Klein called my freshman prose verbose and obtuse, Galbraith Crump brought Shakespeare to life, Perry Lenz left America&#x2019;s great literary heritage deeply imprinted on my soul, and John Ward showed me unexpected joy in Smollett, Defoe, Bronte, Austen, Richardson, and Thackeray.</p><p>In Utah, so many surgeons proved critical to my training, including fellow residents, faculty, and dozens of private surgeons. I&#x2019;m compelled to thank Frank Moody for setting such an annoyingly high standard for all of us and for always pushing me to be my best, despite my resistance. Gary Maxwell did more to lead me into transplantation than anyone. He inspired me with both his compassion and his astonishing abilities.</p><p>At Pittsburgh, I learned kidney transplantation from Tom Hakala, Tom Rosenthal, and Rod Taylor. I witnessed the unflinching integrity of Hank Bahnson, the unbreakable loyalty of Shun Iwatsuki, and the unstoppable drive of Tom Starzl. I owe more than I can ever express to Shun for being there to save my sorry ass over and over, and to Tom for being the font from which so many of my opportunities flowed.</p><p>In 1985, Bob Baker, Charlie Andrews, Bob Waldman, and, most important, Mike Sorrell and Bing Rikkers put together a proposal that pulled Bob Duckworth, Laurie Williams, Pat Wood, and me from Pittsburgh to Omaha, Nebraska. Together with Joe Anderson, Jim Chapin, Barb Hurlbert, Rod Markin, and Reed Peters, we forever changed the University of Nebraska Medical Center. My appreciation of the risks these people all accepted to make our work such a huge success is undying. Their expertise and dedication were indispensable.</p><p>I have many friends who read my earlier work and encouraged me to keep trying, including Jamie and Kyle, Carlos and Kathy, Bill and Chris, Steve and Genni, Mike Duff, and especially Dirk and Cath, whose friendship and faith are unflinching.</p><p>This book would never have come to life without the reboot I got from Steve Langan and the many participants in his Seven Doctors Project, the stubborn faith and encouragement of Amy Grace Loyd, and Jonis Agee&#x2019;s willingness to introduce me to Noah Ballard, who as my agent has brought wonders to my life. The confident enthusiasm that he and Matthew Daddona, the world&#x2019;s most gently tenacious editor, have brought to this work both astounds and delights me. Bo Caldwell and Ron Hansen unwittingly inspire me, most especially with their grace in success. Lee Gutkind introduced me to creative nonfiction during many sleepless nights together in Pittsburgh; his guidance has been invaluable.</p><p>My brother, Steve, and sisters, Mindy and Beth, may not agree with my versions of the events of our lives upon which I&#x2019;ve shone so much wattage, but obviously my memory is better than theirs. I apologize for repetitively nagging them for details none of us see so clearly anymore, and I thank them for allowing me this indulgence.</p><p>I adored Carol for her art, her spirit, and her courage in facing death. I love Chris for our twenty-five years together, for our three children, and for loving me still. Ryan, Nat, and Joe are my real reason for existence, more for the joy they individually bring to the world than for notions of propagation.</p><p>Most of all, I thank Rebecca for resurrecting me, for nurturing my art, for keeping me honest, and for trusting me with her unfathomable love. I will always dance with you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p>This is not a work of fiction. The events I have written about happened. That said, I must admit that in re-creating them, I have had to rely mostly on memory, not only mine but also that of many other people who were present or aware of what occurred. I was regularly surprised by how often my most indelible memories were not those of others. This sometimes led us to intense debate, and if we failed to resolve our confusion, I almost always stuck with my version because it felt most faithful to my experience.</p><p>Many of the stories involve patients. To protect their identities, I have changed or left out names, dates, places, and other details that are considered protected health information. These stories are thus merely representative of real experiences rather than the experiences of individual patients. I also found relevant aspects of some patients&#x2019; stories in public records, including newspaper and television archives, obituaries, court records, and social media sites.</p><p>I was a transplant surgeon and most of my patients were recipients of liver transplants. Their stories are sacred. Their wait for a donor on the one hand and the heroism of organ donation on the other remain the most compelling part of the transplant story. I, almost as much as our patients, owe everything to the donors; more specifically, to their survivors who gave consent for donation. Without those acts of grace and courage, none of the patients I met would have survived, and I would never have experienced the joy and despair of trying to save them. Like many professionals who care for these patients, I lived every day of my clinical career with the horrible reality that more than half the people awaiting organs will never get them. We all long for the day when that is no longer true.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Expectations</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pittsburgh 1981</p><p>Initiation I</p><p>I was desperate to show how good I was that night. The patient was Max Stinson, a liver surgeon from Texas who, ironically, had a congenital form of liver disease that had finally progressed to liver failure. He was already opened up on the operating table when we got back from Virginia with the donor liver. Shun Iwatsuki was scrubbed in and had half a dozen other people helping him. Most of them left when we scrubbed in, but Shun stayed.</p><p>Dr. Starzl wasn&#x2019;t happy. Shun stood across from him. He had worked with Starzl in Denver and in the course of time, no one would be more important to my training. Dr. Hong from Shanghai stood to Starzl&#x2019;s right. His job was to retract the rib cage out of Starzl&#x2019;s way. He held on to the upper wound with both hands and leaned back like a water-skier. I would soon learn they called him the Human Retractor. Carlos Fernandez-Bueno was in his second year of training. He, too, had come from Denver, but by fall he would leave to accept a job he couldn&#x2019;t refuse at a prestigious East Coast center.</p><p>Starzl immediately began complaining. Shun kept silent and moved like a cat to retract something one way, push something else another, and, without a word, get Hong or Carlos to do something useful. I thought them telepathic, and this was their desperate attempt to appease the angry alpha. Already I doubted my own survival, useless as I was in this new world.</p><p>Shun&#x2019;s incision was shaped like the arms of a flattened Mercedes hood ornament, with a short vertical line coming downward from the base of the sternum to join a broad inverted V that stretched from one side of the abdomen to the other. Except for the donor in Virginia earlier that night, I&#x2019;d never seen a body split so widely before.</p><p>I caught a glimpse of the liver lurking under the diaphragm. It was a shriveled, knobby, greenish-yellow lump. It was much too small for the space around it and it sloshed around in a puddle of blood every time the ventilator fired and pushed the diaphragm down.</p><p>Blood seemed to be coming from everywhere. The skin of the abdomen below the incision was a translucent, muddy yellow and coursed with giant blue veins running outward from the navel. I could see that the incision transected the course of some of these vessels, and when Starzl started removing sponges from around the edges, those veins rivered dark and red.</p><p>Starzl worked furiously to stop the bleeding. He lashed the open veins with silk sutures, grabbing needle holder after needle holder from the scrub tech as Carlos, then Hong, then Shun grabbed the ends and tied them down snug. I grabbed one when I saw my chance and broke it on the second throw.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Starzl said and threw another stitch where I&#x2019;d broken mine. This time I pulled too hard and the silk pulled out of the tissue and a blood torrent erupted. Carlos grabbed a sponge and pressed down, then got out of the way just as Starzl threw another stitch and tied it himself. He threw two more in the same spot, Carlos tied one and Shun the other, and finally the bleeding stopped. Shun frowned at me and vaguely shook his head.</p><p>I decided I could cut the ends of the stitches after they tied them. It was a job we gave to medical students. I was a trained surgeon, and a good one by all accounts back in Utah, where I&#x2019;d finished my training less than a month earlier. So I grabbed a pair of scissors and cut the suture.</p><p>&#x201c;Too short, goddammit,&#x201d; Starzl said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll come loose and he&#x2019;ll bleed to death. Is that what you want?&#x201d;</p><p>He laid down another stitch and Shun tied it, four throws, and I cut it.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s too long,&#x201d; Starzl whined. &#x201c;Come on, now, Shun. Help me. He doesn&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>I worked my last day as a surgery resident at the University of Utah on June 30, 1981. I was thirty-one years old and I wanted to be a transplant surgeon. Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, the father of liver transplantation and perhaps the most renowned transplant surgeon in the world, had granted me a position to train with his team. He had moved his transplant program to Pittsburgh only six months earlier. I&#x2019;d grown up in Ohio but I&#x2019;d never been to Pittsburgh. I hated their football team, the Steelers, because they always beat my beloved Cleveland Browns.</p><p>My wife and I sold her car, gave the pickup truck to a friend, loaded my car and everything else into a rented truck, and headed for Ohio before dawn on Saturday, July 4. Eight miles east of Point of Rocks, Wyoming, we hit an antelope yearling just as the sun rose above the rocks and sage. In Omaha we drove through smoke from a grass fire started by fireworks. In Ohio we unloaded the truck into my father&#x2019;s garage. I turned in the rental on Monday and called Starzl&#x2019;s Pittsburgh office the next day to ask advice about where to find a place to live.</p><p>I had arranged to take the month of July off. I figured five years of surgery residency and the specter of a two-year fellowship in transplant surgery justified it. We&#x2019;d get a place to live and move in and I&#x2019;d have nearly three weeks to do whatever I wanted. It would be like summer vacation when I was twelve.</p><p>The secretary in Starzl&#x2019;s office put me on hold. She said I needed to talk to someone else.</p><p>A female voice with a strange twang I&#x2019;d later recognize as Pittsburghese came on. &#x201c;Dr. Shaw? Where the hell are you?&#x201d;</p><p>I said I was in Ohio, at my father&#x2019;s house.</p><p>&#x201c;You were supposed to be here last week,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;July first, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t understand. I&#x2019;d talked to someone in March. A woman, I said. She promised to tell Dr. Starzl. I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to start until August.</p><p>I looked at the calendar on the wall above the phone in my dad&#x2019;s kitchen. &#x201c;Saturday,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;August first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have any information about that, Dr. Shaw,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Dr. Starzl expected you last week. You&#x2019;ve already missed two nights of call. I suggest you get your butt here today, tomorrow at the latest.&#x201d;</p><p>That was Tuesday morning. By Thursday night, we&#x2019;d driven to Pittsburgh, put money down on a house a few blocks from the hospital, moved what we could with my dad&#x2019;s pickup, and found a grocery store open after ten p.m. I made my way to the hospital Friday morning and that evening my wife called to say the refrigerator had died. On Saturday I was on call when someone broke the window out of my car on the hill above the football stadium. They stole my toolbox and a Utah Jazz coffee mug. Sandee told me she wouldn&#x2019;t have parked up there.</p><p>Sandee was a nurse on the transplant team. She led me around the hospital my first day and told me where not to park on my second. When we went to the adult intensive care unit, a young woman in a short white coat and a shiny new stethoscope draped around her neck asked me to sign a petition banning liver transplants.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re unethical,&#x201d; she explained.</p><p>I wanted to laugh but she was so earnest. I said I was the new transplant fellow.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Then you should definitely sign it.&#x201d;</p><p>She told me that in its first six months, the new transplant team had done six liver transplants and all six patients were dead.</p><p>&#x201c;One time they ran out of blood across the whole state of Pennsylvania,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Shut down surgery everywhere for days. It was awful. Gruesome, actually.&#x201d;</p><p>Sandee said the young woman was exaggerating. The blood shortage thing only happened one time; it was only in Allegheny County and only for part of a day.</p><p>&#x201c;And the kids are all doing great,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;The kids?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;All six of them,&#x201d; Sandee said. &#x201c;Alive and well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, so then you&#x2019;re batting five hundred?&#x201d; The medical student stood with her head cocked, her clipboard resting on her hip.</p><p>&#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t baseball, sweetie,&#x201d; Sandee said. She grabbed my arm and pulled me away and through the automatic door into the hall.</p><p>The University of Pittsburgh didn&#x2019;t have any place to put Starzl and his team when they arrived six months earlier, so they parked him in an unused laboratory, a huge room cleaved by long lab benches, complete with working sinks and gas jets. I shared a desk with the other transplant fellow. It was against the wall between two benches and the phone lines ran overhead, held to ceiling tile frames with bread-bag twist ties. Sandee said it was temporary.</p></p><h2>Film Production Management 101-2nd edition: Management &amp; Coordination in a Digital Age</h2><p><p>Film Production Management 101 and Patz&#x2019; previous <i>Surviving Production</i> were quickly adopted as &#x201c;the&#x201d; essential road map to the business and logistics of on-the-job film &amp; television production since 1997.

A major contribution to Heidegger&#x2019;s provocative dialogue with the pre-Socratics, the book attacks some of the most firmly established conceptions of Greek thinking and of the Greek world. The central theme is the question of truth and the primordial understanding of truth to be found in Parmenides' "didactic poem." Heidegger highlights the contrast between Greek and Roman thought and the reflection of that contrast in language. He analyzes the decline in the primordial understanding of truth&#x2015;and, just as importantly, of untruth&#x2015;that began in later Greek philosophy and that continues, by virtue of the Latinization of the West, down to the present day. Beyond an interpretation of Greek philosophy, <i>Parmenides</i> (volume 54 of Heidegger's Collected Works) offers a strident critique of the contemporary world, delivered during a time that Heidegger described as "out of joint."</p></p><p>This text, as one might expect in a book on ancient philosophy, is heavily flavored with Greek and Latin. It is giving away no secret that Heidegger decried the Latinizing of things Greek, and one of the central themes of the present volume is the impoverishment in the understanding of Being concomitant with such &#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;transporting&#34;&#34;.&#34;&#34; To the reader unfamiliar with Greek, certain passages might appear rather formidable, then. For the rest, the book&#39;s format and content very closely match the source text.<p>Andr� Schuwer (1916-1995) was Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Duquesne University and co-translator (with Richard Rojcewicz) of <i>Plato's</i> Sophist and <i>Basic Questions of Philosophy</i> by Martin Heidegger and <i>Ideas II</i> by Edmund Husserl.</p><p>Richard Rojcewicz teaches philosophy at Point Park College, Pittsburgh. </p></p><h2>Circles in the Snow: A Bo Tully Mystery</h2><p><b>The Sixth and Final Bo Tully Mystery</b><br><br>Bo Tully, Sheriff of Blight County, Idaho, has dealt with small-town crime throughout his long, storied career. Now, contemplating retirement after years on the job, Tully is faced with perhaps his most perplexing case yet. When area bald eagles start getting picked off by a ghost-like killer, and when a prominent local rancher is murdered by an arrow with eagle fletching, things gets complicated fast. In this fast-paced whodunit, Tully has a vast array of suspects to chose from including the rancher&#x2019;s gorgeous, bird-loving wife who mysteriously leaves for a ranch in Mexico the day of the murder; the beautiful chef at the local house of ill repute, who is well-known as a budding ornithologist; and the ranch foreman, who is rumored to be having an affair with his boss&#x2019;s widow.<br><br>Will Tully put the pieces of the puzzle together, yet again? Will sending his dad, the former sheriff of Blight County, along with his number two man, down to Mexico help solve the mystery? And what about the mysterious large circles in the snow that Tully finds around the ranch with no footprints leading in or out of the area?<br><br>It all adds up to another engrossing series of twists and turns. And in the end, Tully gets his man . . . or woman . . . or does he?<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

McManus</b> is a humor writer who began writing as an undergrad at Washington State University. Hundreds of his humor articles have been published in magazines such as <i>Field &amp; Stream</i> and <i>Outdoor Life</i>. He has published more than a dozen humor books, several mysteries, and a children&#x2019;s humor book. Among his recent works are <i>The Tamarack Murders</i>, <i>The Horse in My Garage</i>, <i>Kerplunk!</i>, and <i>The Huckleberry Murders</i>. He lives in Spokane, WA.It&#x2019;s a lot for a guy thinking about retirement to deal with all at once: someone&#x2019;s been killing bald eagles; a widely disliked rancher has been murdered (with an arrow, no less); and mysterious circles, perfectly round, are appearing in the snow. Blight County, Idaho, Sheriff Bo Tully juggles a handful of likely murder suspects with his usual wit and aplomb, while handling his cantankerous, ex-sheriff father with rather less finesse. McManus, who&#x2019;s a humor columnist and nonfiction writer when he&#x2019;s not writing the Tully novels, has a real gift for dialogue and character; the humor in this delightful series comes out of the characters and the situations, not from clever wordplay or comedy set pieces. And it&#x2019;s worth mentioning, for those readers who haven&#x2019;t yet read a Tully novel (this is the sixth), that the mysteries are well crafted and genuinely suspenseful, not merely an excuse for some lighthearted goings-on, but solid puzzlers in their own right. Warning to McManus: you&#x2019;d better not let Bo retire anytime soon. --David Pitt</p><h2>Cultivating Delight: A Natural History of My Garden</h2><p><p>In the mode of her bestseller <em>A Natural History of the Senses,</em> Diane Ackerman celebrates the sensory pleasures of her garden through the seasons. Whether she is deadheading flowers or glorying in the profusion of roses, offering sugar water to a hummingbird or studying the slug, she welcomes the unexpected drama and extravagance as well as the sanctuary her garden offers.</p><p>Written in sensuous, lyrical prose, <em>Cultivating Delight</em> is a hymn to nature and to the pleasure we take in it.</p></p><p>Diane Ackerman relishes the world of her garden. As a poet, she finds within it an endless field of metaphors. As a naturalist, she notices each small, miraculous detail: the hummingbirds and their routines, the showy tulips, the crazy yellow forsythia. Of visiting deer she writes, "I love watching the deer, which always arrive like magic or a miracle or the answer to an unasked question."<p> In her popular book <i>A Natural History of the Senses</i>, Ackerman celebrates the human body; in <i>A Natural History of My Garden</i>, she turns her attention to the world outside the body, outside the human sphere. Structured by seasons, this is a book of subtle shifts, but the reader never feels lost. Her prose is so welcoming, at times it feels like she's talking directly to you, although her lush, poetic language is the opposite of speech.</p><p> Distracted urban readers craving a book that will transport them would do well to spend time immersed in these pages, as will gardeners who've lost appreciation for their plot. Ackerman is a generous writer--a teacher who will share treasured, obscure passages from Beckett or Hawthorne. She's emotional and highly charged, and her descriptions are so clear they're small marvels. She's remarkable for her ability to find mystery everywhere. <i>--Emily White</i></p><p>Poet, essayist, and naturalist, Diane Ackerman is the author of many highly acclaimed works of nonfiction, including <em>A Natural History of the Senses</em> -- a book beloved by readers all over the worldand the volumes <em>Deep Play, A Slender Thread, The Rarest of the Rare, A Natural History of Love, The Moon by Whale Light,</em> and a memoir on flying, <em>On Extended Wings.</em></p><p>Her poetry has been collected into six volumes, among them <em>Jaguar of Sweet Laughter: New and Selected Poems</em> and, most recently, <em>Praise My Destroyer.</em></p><p>Ms. Ackerman has received many prizes and awards, including the John Burroughs Nature Award and the Lavan Poetry Prize.

Exhausted from a hard day's work, Gabriel Raines slept soundly. But as the shrill cry drew closer and the flashing red lights lit the walls inside his bedroom, something registered in the depths of his mind and he stirred.<br><br>Gabe blinked awake, eyes instantly alert as had become his habit during his years as a marine. He'd been out of the corps for years but some things just didn't change.<br><br>The wail of the siren grew louder on the street below the window of his downtown Dallas condominium, then the fire truck shot past and the sounds began to dim as the vehicle drove farther away. With a weary sigh, Gabe turned to look at the red neon numbers on his alarm clock. <em>Three-thirty.</em><br><br>Running a hand over his face, he lay back against the pillow, hoping like hell he'd be able to get back to sleep.<br><br>He might have if his cell phone hadn't started ringing.<br><br>The siren's wail had stopped. The fire truck had reached its destination, which meant the fire was nearby, and the sound of a second engine was beginning to fill the night. Gabe reached toward the nightstand and picked up his cell phone, flipped it open and pressed it against his ear.<br><br>"Whoever this is," he grumbled, "this had better be important."<br><br>"There's a fire at the Dallas Towers." The voice of his foreman, Sam McBride, floated over the line. "Looks like all our hard work is going up in smoke."<br><br>Adrenaline jolted through him. Gabe swung his long legs to the side of the bed. "Are you sure it's the Towers?"<br><br>"I was on my way home, about a block away when I heard the first fire truck. I saw it turn toward the Towers and decided to see what was going on."<br><br>Already off the mattress, Gabe pressed the phone more tightly against his ear. "You see what part of the structure is involved?"<br><br>"I could see flames in the lobby."<br><br>"Son of a bitch." They were almost finished with the major renovation they were doing on the Tower's soaring marble lobby. <em>Almost.</em><br><br>He took a breath to steady himself as he walked toward his closet. "If you were just heading home, you must have had a pretty hot date."<br><br>"I didn't spend the night if that tells you anything."<br><br>Like Gabe, Sam was a bachelor and both of them lived downtown. An area that formerly consisted of run-down buildings was being revitalized, turned into a chic little district of shops and boutiques. Gabe had built the condos Sam lived in, as well as the Las Posas development that housed his own unit.<br><br>"I'm getting dressed. I'll be there in fifteen minutes."<br><br>Gabe closed the phone. He should have known things were going too well. In his experience, every time life went a little too smoothly, bad news lurked around the corner.<br><br>Naked, he crossed to the oak dresser against the far wall, jerked open his underwear drawer and pulled out briefs and a pair of socks. Dragging on a pair of jeans and a Dallas Cowboys T-shirt, he ignored the row of Western boots sitting on the closet floor and shoved his size-thirteen feet into the heavy leather boots he wore when he was working.<br><br>Gabe left the condo and a few minutes later, he was pulling his big white GMC extended cab pickup over to the curb just a little ways down the block from the Towers. Smoke and flame billowed out through the open glass doors leading into the lobby, but the fire boys were at work inside and had three powerful jets of water hitting the building from different angles. With any luck, the blaze would be brought under control before it burned into the offices on the floors above.<br><br>The bad news was, the lobby would have to be completely rebuilt.<br><br><em>Son of a bitch.</em><br><br>"At least the building was insured." Sam McBride strode toward him, almost as tall as Gabe's six-foot-two-inch frame, but instead of having Gabe's dark hair, blue eyes and muscular build, Sam was blond and lanky. On top of being a damned good employee, he was Gabe's best friend.<br><br>"Well, I guess that's something. It'll sure put us behind schedule, though. I was hoping to finish up here, split the crew up, use the guys to finish our other projects."<br><br>"Not gonna happen," Sam said.<br><br>Gabe looked up to see one of the firemen walking toward them in full battle gear: fire protection suit, helmet, goggles, high rubber boots.<br><br>"Be better if you stepped back a little," the fireman said, "kept out of the way."<br><br>"I'm Gabriel Raines. My company's been rebuilding the lobby. A lot of my equipment is still in there."<br><br>"Sorry to hear that, Mr. Raines. Most everything in the lobby's completely gone. It was a hot, fast fire. We're lucky we were able to get a handle on it so quickly."<br><br>Gabe blew out a breath. "I hope nobody was hurt."<br><br>"Not that we know of."<br><br>"How'd it start?"<br><br>"Too soon to tell. If the lobby was under construction, there was probably a lot of flammable material around. Paint thinner, drop cloths, stuff that really gets a fire going."<br><br>"We're really careful to seal everything up at the end of the day, pick up whatever we've been using."<br><br>"Like I said, it's too soon to tell. Our investigators will be taking a look at everything, including the security tapes."<br><br>Gabe shook his head. "Afraid that won't help. The old cameras are down. New ones aren't up yet."<br><br>"How many people knew that?"<br><br>"Not many. Replacing the old cameras was kind of a last-minute management decision. Only a few people knew they weren't up and working."<br><br>The fireman nodded and headed back toward the fire, pausing for a moment to speak to a second man in a blue uniform, late forties, salt-and-pepper hair. Gabe realized the man had been moving through the crowd that had gathered to watch the blaze, asking onlookers questions. Now he approached Gabe and Sam.<br><br>"I'm Captain Daily with the arson investigation squad," he said. "You're Raines?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"I understand your company's been working on the lobby reconstruction."<br><br>"Actually, we were damned near done."<br><br>"We've never met but I know who you are. You helped my dad once, Jim Daily? He needed a permit to add a room to his dry-cleaning shop. The building was old and the city was giving him a hard time about it. You put in a good word for him and the permit came through. I appreciate that."<br><br>"I liked your dad. I was sorry to hear he passed away."<br><br>"He was a good man." Daily straightened, returning to the business at hand. He looked over at the destruction in the lobby of the Towers. "I'll need to ask you a couple of questions."<br><br>"No problem. This is my foreman, Sam McBride."<br><br>Daily gave Sam a nod and returned his attention to Gabe. "What time did you get here?"<br><br>"About twenty minutes ago. We both live in the area. Sam was heading home from a date. He followed the fire trucks and gave me a call."<br><br>"You see anyone going in or out of the building?"<br><br>"You guys were already here by the time I arrived," Gabe said. "I didn't see anyone else go in or out."<br><br>Daily turned to Sam. "How about you?"<br><br>Sam glanced over to the crews mopping up the scene. "The first truck was just pulling up. I saw the flames in the lobby and called Gabe. I watched you guys working until he got here. It wasn't long before a crowd started to gather. But no, I didn't see anyone coming or going."<br><br>The captain nodded. "The fireman you were talking to...that's Mike Dougherty. He says the cameras are down."<br><br>"Didn't seem like a big deal. No one was going in and out of the lobby during the remodeling."<br><br>"I'm going to need a list of the people who knew."<br><br>"No problem."<br><br>"Thanks. We'll be in touch if we have any more questions." Daily started back toward the men working the fire and disappeared among the throng of spectators.<br><br>Gabe and Sam stood watching as the fire crews worked. Eventually, the smoke began to thin and one of the water hoses was turned off.<br><br>"Anything you can think of we could have done to cause this thing?" Gabe asked.<br><br>"I was here at the end of the day. We left the place clean as a whistle." Sam shook his head. "We were so damned close to finished."<br><br>"Shit happens," Gabe said.<br><br>"I guess."<br><br>"At least the fire didn't get too out of control and it doesn't look like anyone got hurt. I'll call Fred Parsons, see what he wants us to do." Parsons managed the building. He had hired Raines Construction to do the remodel. The owner was eager to get the lobby finished and the building running smoothly again. Gabe was sure Parsons would want him to get his crew back on the job as soon as possible.<br><br>"I'll talk to Rich Simmons, too," Gabe said. Simmons worked for American Insurance. "We'll need to file a claim." But even if they did, there was a fairly high deductible. Nothing was ever cheap.<br><br>Sam slapped him on the back. "Come on. It's damn near dawn. Neither of us is going to get any more sleep. Let's go get some breakfast."<br><br>They might as well. The horizon had begun to turn a pale purple-gray. Gabe's crew started work at seven and though this job was down for a while, there was still work to be done on several other projects they had going in the area.<br><br>"You're thinking Mrs. Olson's?" Gabe asked. Mrs. Olson's Cafe down the block had the best breakfast in the downtown area and the place opened early.<br><br>"Yeah. I could really use a cup of coffee."<br><br>Gabe checked his heavy stainless-steel wristwatch. "It's after five. Should be open by now."<br><br>They both climbed into Gabe's pickup. The company name, Raines Construction, printed on the door in bold black letters, flashed in the early dawn light. He fired up the big, gas-guzzling V-8 he had vowed to replace with a more economical vehicle on his next purchase and pulled off down the street.<br><br>His stomach growled. A big plate of bacon and eggs was beginning to sound damned good. Might take his mind off having to rebuild the damnable lobby of the Towers.<br><br>Gabe spent the morning working away on his favorite project, the reconstruction of an old theater he owned on a street in Deep Ellum. The brick building had once been a local cinema, back in the days when they were extravagantly decorated and elegant. The ceiling was hand-painted in bright colors with lots of gold leaf. At least it was back in its heyday. The doors leading into the seating area were guarded by huge gilt Egyptian statues.<br><br>Wasn't much of anything left when Gabe had first started. The red velvet seats were completely destroyed, turned into rust and mold by a hole in the roof that had let in years of rain. But the structure itself was still sound, the brick walls sturdy, once he'd had them reinforced.<br><br>He'd bought the place for a song, and a barrel of determination. He wanted to see the Egyptian restored and put back into use. He had already made deals with several local theater groups and the Deep Ellum Arts Festival folks. He had no doubt, once the elegant interior was restored, the theater would again be in great demand.<br><br>Besides, he had a personal love for the past that had started when he was a kid growing up in Wyoming. Wind Canyon was a true Western town and though he and his two brothers had been raised in a dumpy, run-down house near a set of abandoned narrow-gauge railroad tracks, the wooden boardwalks, long bar saloons and surrounding ranches had instilled in him a love of the West.<br><br>All three Raines boys had left Wind Canyon as soon as they had graduated high school, but a few years back his older brother, Jackson, had returned. He'd made a boatload of money in the oil business, bought himself twelve thousand acres of prime cattle land and renamed the old homestead Raintree Ranch.<br><br>Gabe had left Wind Canyon to join the marines. After a four-year stint, he had moved to Dallas and started working in the construction business. With Jackson's help, he bought his first fixer-upper house, remodeled and sold it. He'd liked the work and the money he made and began doing a second one.<br><br>The real estate market was hot and Gabe was a hard worker. He made enough money to start his own company and the business had been growing ever since. Along with that, at Jackson's advice, he'd invested some of his hard-earned dollars in Wildcat Oil, where his brother had worked as a geologist, and that had made money, too.<br><br>He been smart enough to see the recession coming and made changes that kept him from going broke like so many in the construction business had. There were a lot of opportunities, tax credits and incentives, he'd discovered, for doing downtown renovation and area redevelopment. So for the last couple of years he'd shifted his focus to that type of restoration and found he liked that work even more. Liked seeing a near-dead place come back to life, liked what it did for the people who lived in the area.<br><br>Gabe went to work with the nail gun, securing the floor of the stage. He didn't do a lot of his own carpentry these days, but if he wasn't too busy with meetings or solving problems at different job sites, he often lent a hand, doing what had gotten him started in the business in the first place.<br><br>The buzz of a nearby saw went silent and Gabe looked up to see two uniformed policemen sauntering down the aisle in his direction. Setting the nail gun aside, he rose to his feet, jumped off the stage, and strode up the aisle to intercept them.<br><br>"You Gabriel Raines?" the first patrolman asked, Gonzales, his name plate said.<br><br>"That's me. What can I do for you?"<br><br>"The fire at the Towers was definitely arson. We've got a suspect in custody. We'd like you to come down and take a look, see if you might have seen him in the area last night."<br><br><em>Arson. </em>He'd been hoping it was just some kind of electrical problem. "Sure thing, I can do that."<br><br>Officer Gonzales, with the hard-edged features of a seasoned policeman, and Delaney, the baby-faced cub of the pair, walked him back up the aisle.<br><br>"You can come with us or drive down on your own if you prefer," Gonzales said as they stepped into the warm, humid early September air.<br><br>Gabe eyed the white-and-blue patrol car and shook his head. "I'll meet you there." In his younger years, he had ridden in the backseat of a police car more than once.<br><br></p><h2>The Hummingbird: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the author of the acclaimed <em>The Curiosity</em> comes a compelling and moving story of compassion, courage, and redemption.</p><p>Deborah Birch is a seasoned hospice nurse whose daily work requires courage and compassion.

Annie Proulx&#x2019;s <i>Accordion Crimes</i> is a masterpiece of storytelling that spans a century and a continent. Proulx brings the immigrant experience in America to life through the eyes of the descendants of Mexicans, Poles, Africans, Irish-Scots, Franco-Canadians and many others, all linked by their successive ownership of a simple green accordion. The music they make is their last link with the past&#x2014;voice for their fantasies, sorrows and exuberance. Proulx&#x2019;s prodigious knowledge, unforgettable characters and radiant language make <i>Accordion Crimes</i> a stunning novel, exhilarating in its scope and originality.</p><p>Proulx found fertile, if rocky, soil for her first two novels (<i>Postcards</i> and <i>The Shipping News</i>) in the far northeastern corner of North America. In <i>Accordion Crimes</i> she ranges much further afield. The novel follows an accordion from the hands of its maker in Sicily in 1890 until it is flattened by a truck in Florida in 1996. In the intervening century it passes through the hands of a host of unlucky owners and their kin: Abelardo Relampago, who dies from the bite of a poisonous spider; Dolor Gagnon, decapitated by his own chain saw; Silvano, cut down in the jungles of Venezuela by an Indian's arrow.<i>Accordion Crimes</i> traces the long odyssey of a button accordion, an instrument made by a Sicilian who immigrates to New Orleans in 1891. Imprisoned in a round-up of Italian suspects after the political murder of the chief of police, the accordion maker is lynched, and his accordion falls into the hands of Apollo, a black steamboat screwman. The instrument begins its long, erratic voyage through 20th-century America, passing through the hands of the descendants of slaves, immigrants and their children, some of whom learn that the cost of becoming American is to surrender the private definition of self. <p> <i>Accordion Crimes</i> is alive with vividly drawn characters who sometimes meet violent, strange ends, and who, at other times, succeed in a hard world. Filled with indelible images, Proulx's latest novel is charged with sardonic wit and is, at different turns, darkly hilarious and heartbreakingly sad. What we see as the accordion weakens and disintegrates is a haunting and ominous sense of what is America.</p></p><h2>G.

The "ACD Method" developed and refined by Mark Fisher after many years of successful trading, provides price points at which to buy and sell as determined by the opening range of virtually any stock or commodity. This comprehensive guide details a widely used system that is profitably implemented by many computer and floor traders at major New York exchanges. The author's highly accessible teaching style provides readers of The Logical Trader with a full examination of the theory behind the ACD Method and the examples and real-world trading stories involving it.<br> Mark B. Fisher (New York, NY), an independent trader, is founder of MBF Clearing Corp., the largest clearing firm on the NYMEX. Founded in 1988, MBF Clearing has grown from handling under one percent of the volume on the NYMEX to nearly twenty percent of the trades today. A 1982 summa cum laude graduate from the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania, Fisher also received his master's degree in finance and accounting from Wharton.<br> New technology and the advent of around the clock trading have opened the floodgates to both foreign and domestic markets. Traders need the wisdom of industry veterans and the vision of innovators in today's volatile financial marketplace. The Wiley Trading series features books by traders who have survived the market's ever changing temperament and have prospered-some by reinventing systems, others by getting back to basics. Whether a novice trader, professional or somewhere in-between, these books will provide the advice and strategies needed to prosper today and well into the future.</p><p>For over fifteen years, Mark Fisher has taught thousands of people-from traders on the floors of major exchanges to individual investors in front of computer screens-how to trade stocks, commodities, even currencies, using his highly successful and innovative ACD method. Now, in The Logical Trader: Applying a Method to the Madness, Fisher will teach you how to use the ACD method to trade more effectively and profitably than ever before.<br> <br> The Logical Trader opens with an in-depth discussion that outlines the basics of the ACD method-plotting particular price points in relation to the opening range-and shows you how this method allows you to gain reference points against which to trade the "A" and "C" points for entry and the "B" and "D" points as stops. You'll also learn about pivot ranges and how you can combine them with ACD to maximize position size while minimizing your risk.<br> <br> Along the way, Fisher discusses some very important psychological issues-No Ego, Gaming Theory, and The Concept of "Next!"-that, when combined with ACD, can be adapted to any trading style or methodology. After a question-and-answer section designed to assess what you've learned in the first half of the book, The Logical Trader continues to show you how to use the ACD method in tandem with other trading tools by:<br> * Exploring strategies using pivot moving averages, such as moving average fake-out (MAF) and moving average divergence trades (MAD)<br> * Discussing various trading strategies that allow you to exit trades at the optimal time<br> * Highlighting trading stories that involve risk management strategies<br> <br> Step by step, The Logical Trader will show you how to use the ACD method to calculate the prices above which you'd want to be long and the prices below which you'd want to be short. Using other indicators and measures, which are layered on top of the ACD base, you'll also learn how to construct a trading plan based upon prevailing prices and market activity.<br> <br> As long as the market you are trading has sufficient volatility and liquidity, you can use the ACD method for everything from ultra-short-term day trading to longer-term position trading. Whether you're a novice trader or you've been at it for years, you'll find that the ACD system has something to offer you and your style of trading. Filled with real-world stories, accessible examples, and anecdotes of traders who have successfully used this method, The Logical Trader fully explains the ACD method and shows you how to get the most out of it.Praise for The Logical Trader<br> Applying a Method to the Madness<br> <br> "Fisher's messianic willingness to share with the public the successful system he has developed is an opportunity to be exploited."<br> -from the Foreword by Paul Tudor Jones<br> Chairman and CEO, Tudor Investment Corp.<br> <br> "Mark takes the same mental approach to trading that professional athletes and coaches use to succeed on the court. He has taken several college and pro athletes and provided them a game plan for life after basketball."<br> -John Calipari, Head Basketball Coach, Memphis University<br> Former NBA Head Coach, New Jersey Nets<br> <br> "I have been actively involved in the markets (foreign exchange, equities, derivatives) since the early 1970s-as a trader on the CBOT floor in the bond and note 'pits,' as a foreign exchange dealer at a large multinational bank, as the head of a bank's futures brokering operation, as a reasonably widely known analyst of the world capital markets writing a daily commentary on these markets, and as a trader on my own. I've read a myriad number of 'how to' books on trading, most of which have proven to be of little merit, if any. However, from the outset, reading and understanding Mark's insights into his ACD system in The Logical Trader, I've learned methods of trading that I probably understood intuitively but now understand logically and with almost numerical rationality. The reading may be difficult for the beginning trader, but the lessons learned will be immediately beneficial; of that I am certain. I strongly endorse this book for the beginner and professional trader alike."<br> -Dennis Gartman, Editor/Publisher, The Gartman Letter, LC<br> <br> In trading, as in life, you need a plan.

Stopped up by dams, slaked off by irrigation, and dried up by cities, the Green is crucial, overused, and at risk, now more than ever.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fights over the river&#x2019;s water, and what&#x2019;s going to happen to it in the future, are longstanding, intractable, and only getting worse as the West gets hotter and drier and more people depend on the river with each passing year. As a former raft guide and an environmental reporter, Heather Hansman knew these fights were happening, but she felt driven to see them from a different perspective&#x2014;from the river itself. So she set out on a journey, in a one-person inflatable pack raft, to paddle the river from source to confluence and see what the experience might teach her. Mixing lyrical accounts of quiet paddling through breathtaking beauty with nights spent camping solo and lively discussions with farmers, city officials, and other people met along the way, <i>Downriver</i> is the story of that journey, a foray into the present&#x2014;and future&#x2014;of water in the West.</p><p><b>Heather Hansman</b> is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in <i>Outside, California Sunday, Smithsonian, </i>and many others.

It can take years of engagement to fully comprehend many of the topics she discusses, such as tribal water rights. But Hansman&#x2019;s writing is clear and succinct, and she has done a great deal of research. As someone who has spent the better part of a decade thinking about Colorado River governance, I was impressed by the book. Hansman exceeded my expectations.

So taking a step back to ponder the dimensions and practices of a particular way of thinking is a challenge. Even more important, however, is cultivating the habits of mind necessary in a life of ministry. This book, therefore, will grapple with the particular ways that the theological disciplines invite students to think but also the ways in which thinking theologically shapes a student's sense of self and his or her role in a wider community of belief and thought. Thinking theologically is not just a cerebral matter; thinking theologically invokes an embodied set of practices and values that shape individuals and communities alike. Thinking theologically demands both intellect and emotion, logic and compassion, mind and body. In fact, this book&#x2014;as part of the Foundations for Learning series&#x2014;will contend that these binaries are actually integrated wholes, not mutually exclusive options.</p><p>Eric D.

Lauded by today&#39;s finest magicians and critics, Hiding the Elephant is a cultural history of the efforts among legendary conjurers to make things materialize, levitate, and disappear. Steinmeyer unveils the secrets and life stories of the fascinating personalities behind optical marvels such as floating ghosts interacting with live actors, disembodied heads, and vanishing ladies. He demystifies Pepper&#39;s Ghost, Harry Kellar&#39;s Levitation of Princess Karnak, Charles Morritt&#39;s Disappearing Donkey, and Houdini&#39;s landmark vanishing of Jennie the elephant in 1918. The dramatic mix of science and history, with revealing diagrams, photographs and magicians&#39; portraits by William Stout, provides a glimpse behind the curtain at the backstage story of magic.</p><p>JIM STEINMEYER has designed illusions for all of today&#x2019;s leading magicians including Ricky Jay, for his Broadway show On the Stem, David Copperfield, and Siegfried and Roy, Las Vegas revues, and television specials, and the late Doug Henning. He is the writer and producer of A&amp;E&#x2019;s four-hour history of magic, The Story of Magic, and author of many books and articles on the history of magic and theatrical effects. He lives in Los Angeles.The success of a magician "lies in making a human connection to the magic." Create an illusion in the audience's mind, and they're hooked. But to understand magicians, we need to understand the art of that creation. Steinmeyer, who has designed illusions for Siegfried and Roy and David Copperfield, presents a cultural history of magic's golden age (from the 1890s to the 1930s), some legendary tricks (including the Levitation of Princess Karnak and Harry Houdini's Disappearing Elephant) and the fierce rivalries that dominated the craft. Steinmeyer reveals certain secrets, which rely on engineering, artistry and sheer chutzpah, but he hasn't betrayed anyone; most of his information has been published elsewhere. What he adds is context. Magicians advertise deceit, then perform it. Unlike political chicanery, which Steinmeyer dubs dishonest trickery, magic is a kind of pure trickery. Audiences pay for a ruse, not a lecture on fraud. Do we believe movie special effects are real? Of course not, but it doesn't detract from our enjoyment. Similarly, while many 19th-century spiritualists were rightfully debunked as frauds and charlatans, audiences loved the antics. Some, such as the Davenport brothers, were a magnet of controversy and a wild hit, successfully mixing "religion, agnosticism, science, superstition, and fraud." Steinmeyer diagrams famous tricks, celebrating their science and ingenuity. Readers meet characters as colorful as their acts. Buyer beware: If you want to keep your illusions, go to Las Vegas. But for magic lovers who revel in learning the magician's art, this book part research study, part salute is a find. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos and diagrams.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Polymer Clay Artist&#39;s Guide: A Directory of Mixes, Colors, Textures, Faux Finishes, and Surface Effects</h2><p><p> <b><i>A directory of mixes, colors, textures, faux finishes and surface effects. </i></b> </p><p> This resource provides polymer clay artists with a library of 100 finishes and techniques suitable to a wide variety of applications.

He lives in Concord, Massachusetts.<br><br>Randy Testa has taught literature and medical ethics at Harvard and Dartmouth Medical Schools. He is an editor at <i>Doubletake</i> magazine and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.In their introduction to this anthology of short literary works showing facets of life in medical care, Coles and Testa reflect fears that our medical schools are still not adequately preparing students to "understand and connect [with patients in] heart, mind, and soul." The editors and their three collaborators assembled the anthology with the hope that it might offer readers in the health care professions a fresh perspective on their responses to those they care for each day. The 53 selections are grouped according to four attributes: altruism, knowledge, skill, and duty. These attributes have been specified by the Medical School Objectives Project of the Association of American Medical Colleges as those needed by medical graduates when they enter the world of medicine. Some of the selections are essays; some are poems; and some are very short stories. Some of the authors are widely known -- Anton Chekhov, Walt Whitman, and William Carlos Williams, for example. Some are known mainly within medicine -- Eric J. Cassell, Lewis Thomas, John Stone, and Abraham Verghese. Some are probably known only to their immediate colleagues. The short introduction to each selection defines its place in literature and tells us something about its author. The title of the book, A Life in Medicine, suggests that it is a biography or autobiography. It would have been more informatively cast as Lives in and around Medicine. The voices from those lives differ widely in their identities. Yes, some are the voices of persons directly involved in medicine: a medical student, a nurse, a physician, a resident. Others are the voices of persons whose lives touch medicine in some way: a patient, the family of a patient, a social observer. All these voices are relevant to medicine and how it is practiced. Most of the selections reflect specific episodes: clinical errors, cultural clashes, or interior reflections on clinical encounters. Several of the essays -- notably those by Cassell and Thomas -- are detached analyses of practice in contemporary medicine, but they do serve to support Coles's and Testa's central thesis. Will the works collected here do what the editors hope they will? Will they show health care workers how to see, or see more clearly, the distress, the suffering, and the anguish of patients and their families, even of Ingelfinger's "worried well"? Would other choices have been better? The English-language literature relevant to the editors' aims is enormous. Every reader of this anthology is likely to think of alternatives that might be more effective. For a terse and powerful description of pain I can think of no more relevant work than Emily Dickinson's 1862 poem that opens, "Pain -- has an Element of Blank --." And there is Fanny Burney's wrenching account of undergoing breast surgery without anesthesia in an 1811 letter to her sister. But Coles's and Testa's choices do serve their aim. Some physicians, even if they left medical school poorly educated in seeing patients as persons, come to see the importance of this skill. They will certainly be one of the audiences for this anthology. The other audience members may be readers not working in health care fields but becoming involved in any of them as patients or members of patients' families. For them, the book might simply echo their views of what goes on in doctors' offices and hospitals. Its more valuable effect might be to empower them to ask for, and expect to receive, what seems missing but sorely needed in clinical engagements. A piece such as Anne Fadiman's account of a collision between a Laotian Hmong family and California clinicians is a good example of what may become an increasingly frequent problem in multiethnic America. The "outs" may see in this anthology support for their desire to get better care from the "ins." Such expectations of those who do not feel understood in our health care system can be unnerving to some clinicians who have left medical training with an all-too-common sense of omniscience about all matters medical. This is an aspect of medical education that should change. Patients and their families now search the Internet for clearer answers to their medical questions and what might be done about their concerns. They read accurate medical reporting in the New York Times, Newsweek, and other popular publications. Then they raise questions: "Doctor, what do you think about such-and-such for my condition?" I do not know whether Coles and Testa hoped that this anthology would empower those who have thought of raising such questions, but I think it might. Will this anthology and the many persons in and out of medicine who agree with its central thesis be able to influence our medical schools to prepare their graduates more effectively to see patients as persons? I doubt it. Many schools, perhaps most, are now medical universities: assemblies of research institutes and financially profitable units engrossed in producing technically skillful subspecialists, and not schools focused mainly on training students in the skills central to the practice of medicine, whatever their final choice of specialty. Prestige, reputation, and power hinge on eminence in research and on how many dollars can be squeezed out of the National Institutes of Health or from industrial collaborations, not on the skills of their graduates in patient-physician relations. <i>Edward J.

Caught between the giants of the Soviet Union and the Third Reich, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia became pawns in the desperate battle for control of Eastern Europe throughout the course of World War II. This is a story of conquest and exploitation, of death and deportation and the fight for survival both by countries and individuals. The three states were repeatedly occupied -- by the Soviet Union in 1939, by Germany in 1941, and again by the Soviet Union in 1944-45. In each case, local government organizations and individuals were forced to choose between supporting the occupying forces or forming partisan units. Many would be caught up in the bitter fighting in the region and, in particular, in the huge battles for the Courland bridgehead during Operation Bagration when hundreds of thousands of soldiers would fight and die in the last year of the war. Over 300,000 Soviet troops would be lost during the repeated assaults on the &#39;Courland Cauldron&#39; before 146,000 German and Latvia troops were finally forced to surrender. No mercy was shown and all Latvians, Lithuanians, and Estonians who fought for Germany were executed. By the end of the war, death and deportation had cost the Baltic States over 20 percent of their total population and the iron curtain would descend on the region for over four decades. Using numerous first-hand accounts and detailed archival research, Prit Buttar weaves a magisterial account of the bitter fighting on the Eastern Front and the three small states whose fates were determined by the fortunes and misfortunes of war.</p><p>Prit Buttar studied medicine at Oxford and London before joining the British Army as a doctor.

Always had been. Earlier in life his all-consuming search was for more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more recognition, money and possessions, friends and lovers, opportunities and advancement, pleasures and satisfaction&#x2014;what he had come to believe was &#x201c;the good life.&#x201d; And he had achieved a fairly good measure of success in most of these areas. Lately, however, he could no longer run away from or deny a desperate feeling of hollowness that saturated most of his waking moments. Everything acquired thus far not only failed to deliver much joy, it seemed only to intensify his yearning. Now he began to search for something beyond&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for a better way, higher meaning, greater fulfillment. He worked hard at his labors and tried to live a good life, yet he was haunted by the beckoning of this something beyond. He couldn&#x2019;t quite define it, but it was real in his heart.</p><p>Sometimes he felt close to the discovery, but lately it felt more out of reach than ever. This seeming lack of progress was unsettling, disheartening, frustrating. Self-doubt washed over him and he wondered if the searching was mere fantasy or a ceaseless dissatisfaction with life. Maybe it was time to give up, let it all go, find a way to make do.</p><p>Then he heard the news: an awakened one&#x2014;a keeper of the mystic keys to truth, happiness, and freedom&#x2014;was traveling in this region. Few, they said, had been allowed to speak with this lofty soul, but many had been comforted and blessed just by being in this one&#x2019;s presence. The seeker&#x2019;s heart leapt. He knew he had to sit at the feet of this master, no matter what it required of him. Though his pursuit took several weeks of arduous travel, his determination brought him successfully to the awakened one&#x2019;s encampment. The seeker pleaded so fervently that the attendants were moved to convene a special council. Finally they announced that the seeker would be granted an unprecedented audience the next morning. He rejoiced and hardly slept at all.</p><p>At dawn&#x2019;s first light, he was ushered away from the main camp to a clearing in the forest. Sitting by a small fire was the great sage, enfolded in a hooded white robe. The seeker knelt on the other side of the fire, lost control, and began to sob. Then he caught his breath, composed himself, and told of his lifelong searching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the passion, the relentlessness, and, lately, the frustration.</p><p>When finished, he felt pangs of embarrassment from this uncontrolled litany. He looked up in time to see the great one pull back the hood of the robe. The seeker was stunned. The master before him was a woman, and her radiance immediately sent waves of warmth flooding over him. Her features expressed the essence of feminine energy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gentle yet powerful, ageless, wizened, compassionate. It was not what he had expected, yet somehow he knew it was exactly what he needed.</p><p>She began to speak, but not of simple answers. Instead, she offered him an opportunity if he was up to it, a chance to challenge himself beyond anything he&#x2019;d attempted thus far. Would he be willing to be placed in a situation in which he would have to find a way out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an experience that would force him to find a different approach? There was a risk, she explained. He could get lost in this experience, languish, or even perish in it. As he considered her invitation he felt a tightening of fear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. followed by a greater quickening of anticipation. He agreed to submit himself to this unknown trial. After all, how could it be worse than the constant gnawing he felt most of his days?</p><p>Sensing the seeker&#x2019;s sincerity, the awakened one rose and moved slowly before him. She lifted her hands and placed them upon his forehead. The seeker was immediately plunged into an alternate reality. He felt himself accelerating beyond control down some sort of passageway or corridor. After a while he slowed, but was then thrust into a very dark space. When he fell to its floor, the space closed all around him and he lay stunned in a cavernous darkness. When his eyes adjusted, he could barely make out that he was, indeed, trapped in a cave. Where was the lesson in this? he wondered.</p><p>After a while he began to look for a way out of this place. His hands groped all over the walls, looking for an opening of any kind. But he couldn&#x2019;t find any. Just when he thought he was lost and destitute, a minimal serving of food and water appeared as if by magic. This sustained him as he continued to search for a way out. He lost all track of time and marked his days by the appearance of his meal. At one point, he began to climb up little crevices in the wall, thinking that an opening might be near the ceiling of this cave. But again he found nothing and several times fell back to the floor. Day after day he searched. He scoured every inch of the place to no avail. He felt totally trapped and bruised in so many ways.</p><p>As dark as was the cave, after a while the seeker stumbled into an even darker place within himself. He became uncontrollably angry. He shouted, cursed, and railed against God, against the sage by the campfire, against life itself. Then he turned on himself, verbally lacerating himself as a miserable, lost, worthless being. No wonder he was cast into this living hell. After ranting for who knows how long, he collapsed in utter dejection and hopelessness. He felt like he was melting into the floor of the cave, into nothingness.</p><p>There was no more fight in him.</p><p>It was then that he realized something that gave him his first sense of relief in a long time: it wasn&#x2019;t his entrapment that was the real problem; it was the nature of his searching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forceful, controlling, violent in its own way. He came to understand for the first time that this kind of searching was futile, even damaging. It made finding an opening more elusive than ever. It was getting him nowhere, wearing him out. And&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was preparing him for something else.</p><p>Having played out so much within himself, he now felt empty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a good way. No longer did he scrutinize the walls, ceiling, and floor of the cave. He closed his eyes and became still. He asked for help and surrendered his resistance to the unknown. He made his awareness pliable and let go of his certainties and judgments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about everything.</p><p>Then it began: The seeker perceived a light gently glowing within him. How had he not seen this before? He took his whole attention there and gave himself to the light&#x2019;s allure. He felt himself moving again but in a different way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. expanding. The cave could no longer confine him. He didn&#x2019;t leave it, really; he grew bigger. The cave of darkness began to shrink into a small space within him while, at the same time, he began to enlarge as an extension of the light. The illusion was that he was within the cave; now he knew that, in truth, the cave was within him, and at that very moment, he was free. His opening was found not through overcoming, but by becoming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. becoming more than the dark place. It was the realization of realizations: The way out was not &#x201c;out there&#x201d; but &#x201c;in here.&#x201d; A portal to a more expansive and powerful reality, a Light, was within him&#x2014;then, and in every situation, all the time, no matter what.</p><p>He relaxed and opened his eyes. To his surprise, he was sitting by that campfire again in the presence of the revered sage. He looked deeply into her eyes and she smiled knowingly. Now he understood. A deep and marvelous Joy surged forth from the wellspring he had discovered within himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he, too, smiled.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>As with most teaching stories and parables, this is my story, your story, everyone&#x2019;s story. We are all seekers, not because something is missing that we must struggle to find. We search for more because we are made of more, so much more than we usually know. We are participants in greater dimensions of reality than we realize when trapped in worldly, ego-oriented awareness. There are times when human experience is really difficult and painful. But have you ever sensed that something in your approach might be making it even more troublesome&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that there is a pathway of life mastery that could not only free you but also evolve you? Have you sensed a deep calling to discover and master more enlightened ways?</p><p>Consider this: in our hardened world and our busy lives&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. amid our problems, issues, and troubles with others&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are openings. These openings are higher realizations that create inner actualizations. When we see the opening&#x2019;s light, even as an inner ember, and let these higher realizations have their way with us, we are ushered into greater frequencies of awareness and expanded dimensions of life mastery.</p><p>It is then that we experience more lofty and powerful aspects of the authentic Self, our spiritual nature, and its profound capacities.</p><p>It is then that we have the wherewithal to open to more effective responses and answers.</p><p>It is then that we know, with certainty, that there is that Something within us that is always greater than anything facing us.</p><p>It is then that we expand and transcend.</p><p>It is then that we can find light in the darkness and open up to a limitless storehouse of opportunities and possibilities.</p><p>It is then that we become the healers and peacemakers that God, the Creative Source of all Life, has designed each of us to be.</p><p>It is then, as a mystic put it, that we &#x201c;let God be God&#x2014;in, through, and as us.&#x201d;</p><p>When circumstances seem very dark, it is transforming to remember that all things are more than they seem to be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that <i>you</i> are more than you seem to be. There is a way to find openings into life mastery that are different from the &#x201c;usual&#x201d; approaches. It is not found by aggressive searching or by fighting, resisting, or attacking whatever is going on. It is not found by hiding or suppressing aspects of ourselves. In the language of integral philosophy, the more powerful approach is to transcend and include. It is being willing to grow larger in awareness than the dark spaces, ever mindful that though the dark spaces may be reduced, they do continue to reside within us. In the language of spiritual psychology, this is embracing the rejected or disowned parts of us&#x2014;the shadow&#x2014;just as the seeker finally quit fighting parts of himself. In this way, we embrace all that we are and are freed to expand into greater dimensions of awareness and livingness. A greater light guides our way into newness, wholeness, and mastery.</p><p>There are times in life to push forward, to make things happen, to take a dominating approach. This is the masculine dynamic in full expression, and it is also the foremost strategy employed throughout most aspects of Western culture. In fact, to take any other approach is very often ridiculed, much as introversion is often erroneously held to be inferior to extroversion. However, our cultural imbalance toward the masculine has produced significant shortcomings and challenges. Since every person is a composite of masculine and feminine qualities, true mastery calls for a balancing of these modes of being. There are, equally, times to cease resisting, to allow, to expand, to become more&#x2014;engaging the wisdom of the feminine&#x2014;rather than to demand, attack, or coerce things. Most inner growth occurs when the feminine dynamic is introduced to balance the masculine, and it is becoming more and more clear that the most powerful arrangement is for the feminine aspect of each of us to be in overall leadership on our path, with the masculine toolkit being utilized wisely to bring forth results when this is appropriate. At the collective level, a renewal of the leadership of the divine Feminine is now essential for the evolution of humanity as we seek openings into greater peace and well-being for all.</p><p>Most often, the caves that trap and limit us are our definitions and judgments of things. By insisting on these limiting definitions and judgments, we stay trapped, frustrated, and bruised. The opening is found by discovering and embracing a more expansive realization of what is going on and who we are. By dissolving the illusion that life&#x2019;s fullness and greatness is missing, we free ourselves from the unyielding and debilitating search for more and better. Then a greater potential can be birthed, suppressed magic can be unleashed. Situations begin to transform as awareness expands. Miracles, healings, and serendipity emerge without all the struggle and aggressiveness. What unfolds is of a higher order than what otherwise would have been. There is the wondrous realization that, in this process, we have become instruments of something greater&#x2014;call it God, Spirit, Love, Truth, or whatever you choose. This is the next stage of human evolution, for we are the enlightened ones we have been seeking. That is what this book is all about.</p><p>What follows in the next two parts is a rich set of opportunities to move from searching to becoming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to discover and move through life-empowering openings. These openings complement one another and can lead us into the experience of powerful new dimensions of mastery. This mastery is not acquiring something missing, nor is it a conquering of opponents or obstacles; it is an empowering of our awareness of what life really is, who we really are, and how we can create a masterful relationship with anything that might seem to block our progress. You will learn how to go from resistance to transcendence.</p><p>Part Two will support you in moving through openings into truth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. giving you a more expansive and empowered understanding of reality that alone can change and up-level everything. Then, Part Three will give you the keys for transforming the difficult situations we all encounter on life&#x2019;s journey. You will be equipped with insights and tools to enhance your awareness. You will be shown how to grow beyond old limitations and how to create openings for healings and blessings greater than you might ever have imagined. Each chapter begins with &#x201c;The Essence,&#x201d; core realizations about that particular opening&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. followed by &#x201c;The Experience,&#x201d; how that opening has been discovered or used in life experiences&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then &#x201c;The Expression,&#x201d; ways you can activate and move through each opening.</p><p>It is all about moving into the masterful You! The spiritual teacher and writer Ernest Holmes offered a pivotal reminder: <i>That which you are searching for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are searching with.</i> Twentieth-century Indian guru Ramana Maharshi also declared: <i>There is no greater mystery than this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that we keep seeking Reality though, in fact, we are Reality. </i>May the teachings in this book become for you dynamic openings into all things great, gracious, and glorious!

A quiet, introspective thinker, Andre started out as a trooper in the SAS before being commissioned into the Rhodesian Light Infantry Commandos, where he was engaged in fireforce combat operations. He then rejoined the SAS. Wounded 13 times, his operational record is exceptional even by the tough standards that existed at the time. He emerged as the SAS officer par excellence; beloved by his men, displaying extraordinary calmness, courage, and audacious cunning during a host of extremely dangerous operations.

As a boy, holidays were spent with Game Department rangers; time on safari in Mozambique with the late Wally Johnson was a big influence on him. Wessels also grew to know Robert Ruark whose love of Africa, its people, politics and the written word left a lasting impression. He saw action in the Rhodesian bush war before acquiring a law degree which he chose not to use. He has hunted big game in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania in a 20-year career. In 1994 he was severely gored by a wounded buffalo which almost cost him his life. While no longer directly involved in hunting, he is part-owner of a lodge and game ranch in Zambia on the Zambezi and remains keenly interested in all matters relating to African wildlife and conservation. He has published Strange Tales from Africa in the USA, a collection of anecdotes from his hunting days. He is also a syndicated writer for Outdoor Life in the United States and is currently writing a history on the Rhodesian SAS. He is married to Mandy and has two daughters, Hope and Jana, and lives in Darling in the Western Cape of South Africa.<br><br>After a childhood on a farm in the Rhodesian bush, Andre Scheepers joined the Rhodesian Light Infantry commandos, followed by the SAS in 1974. In the thick of the action during the Rhodesian Bush War he was wounded on 12 occasions. Turning down an opportunity to go into the British SAS, he elected instead to join a seminary and later became a priest. A true leader, beloved by his men, his calmness in extreme danger coupled with his ability to think his way out of tight corners made him the quintessential SAS officer.&#x201c;It is a book that left me breathless, angered and saddened. It is a book about soldiers fighting a war they were not allowed to win; a war to save a country from itself. It is a book of immense bravery and sacrifice against incredible odds. It is a book that proves that some men are born to become warriors, others to become heroes. Only a select few are born to be both.&#x201d; (Lt.

Venter, author and war correspondent)</p><h2>The Book of Mystical Chapters: Meditations on the Soul&#39;s Ascent, from the Desert Fathers and Other Early Christian Contemplatives</h2><p>The early Christian monks of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine were the spiritual heroes of their age&#x2014;fleeing the security of civilization for the desert, where they sought God in lives of prayer, contemplation, and radical simplicity. This book is a portable collection of their teachings, and those of their contemplative contemporaries, ranging from the fourth through the eleventh centuries. It is arranged to the traditional model of three ascending "books": <i>Praktikos</i> (practice), <i>Theoretikos</i> (theory), and <i>Gnosis</i> (knowledge). Each book consists of 100 "sentences"&#x2014;aphorisms or thoughts. Each sentence is intended to be read and meditated upon for an entire day&#x2014;just as the monks themselves might have done as they went about their work.</p><p><i>The Book of Mystical Chapters</i> wants to slow you down. Its 300 brief meditations, drawn from the writings of the earliest Christian contemplatives, are meant to be read over the course of 300 days. The book's translator and editor, John Anthony McGuckin, explains that this is how early Christian pilgrims learned the wisdom of the Desert Fathers, ascending through three stages of spiritual understanding, from the practical to the transcendent. Pilgrims repeated these meditations until each one broke "like a fruit on the tongue of the monk and revealed its inner flavor to the searching mind." <i>The Book of Mystical Chapters</i> suggests that readers ask of each aphorism, "How have we already experienced it; how could it illuminate a truth about our own heart or the troubles of our friends' hearts or the secret ways that God wishes to develop our seeking soul?" If you're sick of wasting time waiting at the bus stop, waiting between appointments, or waiting to go deeper in faith, maybe this is just the thing for you. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>John Anthony McGuckin is a Professor of Early Church History at Union Theological Seminary in New York City and a priest of the Orthodox Church. Born in Newcastle, England, he is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the author of nine books, including <i>Standing in God's Holy Fire: The Byzantine Tradition </i> and <i>At the Lighting of the Lamps: Hymns of the Ancient Church. </i></p><h2>Lost Thing</h2><p>Lost Thing</p><p><p>Shaun Tan ("A Day in the Life") grew up in Perth, Western Australia, and made up for the fact that he was the shortest kid in every class by being known as a "good drawer." Besides working full-time as an illustrator of his own stories, Shaun has worked as a designer in theater and film, and also directed the Academy Award winning short film The Lost Thing.</p>What exactly is "The Lost Thing"? There aren't any lost pet notices in the paper, and parents don't seem to take any notice. Friend Pete seems unimpressed, but the compassionate hero of this thought-provoking tale is determined to locate a home for the creature, elusive though it may be. The narration and production add to the mystery surrounding "The Lost Thing." Humphrey Bower is quiet and tentative as the story unfolds. His voice repeatedly trails off, highlighting the story's tone of bewilderment. The sound effects and upbeat music lend a science fiction flair. Listeners will ponder the story as they pore over Tan's detailed and mind-expanding illustrations.

Followers flock to her Kildare abbey and scriptorium.

For this very eve, I must leave Rome for an island so far outside the bounds of civilization it has never merited the attention of our dear Republic: the land of the Gaels.<br><br>That the Lord has summoned me to this mission, I have no doubt. Yet, as dawn broke and I finished my prayers this morning, I would have sworn on the cross that the day would progress like every other.<br><br>I settled at my desk in the chambers of the papal secretary just as the sun's rays began their full celebration of God's good day. Capturing the clarity of the earliest light is as critical to my work as a scrivener<br><br>for the Lord as it is to your work overseeing the family land; thus I was alone in the study. I was preparing to record the edicts emanating from a recent council meeting when I heard my name.<br><br>I turned toward the sound and, to my surprise, saw a papal page in the doorway. He said, "Brother Decius, you are to follow me to an audience in the chambers of His Holiness Pope Simplicius, bishop of Rome."<br><br>The page started off down the long and winding corridors that lead to His Holiness's inner sanctum. I raced after him, wary of losing him in the labyrinthine route connecting the church's official buildings to the palace. I kept his pace, and he left me at the entryway to the pope's own chambers.<br><br>A crimson tapestry separated the sacred inner sanctum from the bustle of the rest of the palace. I approached it, and though I pulled the heavy fabric aside with reverence and care, my fingers caught on the pearls and rubies sewn into the silken embroidery. In that moment of disentanglement, I know not why, I hesitated before crossing the threshold.<br><br>My body began shaking, as it had never trembled before. Yet I knew I could show no fear. Courage is necessary-nay, mandated-for selection to one of Christ's missions. And somehow I knew that this was the purpose of my summoning.<br><br>To expel the devil's own trepidation from my heart and soul, I steeled myself with the image, oft described by you, of our father and mother stoic in the face of the barbarians. If our parents could suffer at their hands and never flinch before the final swing of the crude battle-axe, then, I told myself, I could take the simple step of entering the private chamber of Saint Peter's own representative on this earth.<br><br>Peace descended upon me, almost as though our mother and father spoke from heaven. I left the tapestry to swing in my wake and immediately knelt before His Holiness. Or so I believed.<br><br>"Rise, Brother Decius," the order sounded out.<br><br>I readied myself to confront the intimidating phalanx of aristocratic councillors that accompany His Holiness's every movement, which I had witnessed during my three prior papal audiences. Yet as I rose from my deep genuflection and lifted my eyes, a single figure greeted me. I knew the man only by sight and rumor, as he would never deign to enter the secretary's study: it was Gallienus, a priest and the most senior of the pope's councillors.<br><br>I bowed my head in respect, yet could not help but note the comfortable, nearly languorous, manner in which he leaned against the empty papal throne. "Your Eminence," I said.<br><br>"The twelfth eagle will soon fly," Gallienus said.<br><br>I did not answer at once, uncertain as to his meaning and even more unsure as to the safest response.<br><br>"Are you not familiar with the Prophecy of the Twelve Eagles, Brother Decius?" Gallienus asked.<br><br>"I am, Your Eminence." Indeed, I guess nearly every Roman citizen has heard the divination that the Republic's supremacy will last twelve centuries only, each one represented by an eagle. Even the masses must have heard it bandied about in the bars and streets of the bustling Aventine Quarter in recent times, as the Visigoths rule Rome in all but name and other hordes conquer more and more of the Roman provinces every day. Oh, but this is old, sad news to us true Romans.<br><br>"Then you know that twelve centuries of the Roman Empire's rule as foretold by the twelve eagles are nearly at an end?"<br><br>I paused before answering. I hate to speak ill of a fellow Christian, but the elite Gallienus is known for his wiles and I feared that the question was a trap. If I admitted to an awareness of the prophecy and the few years remaining on it, I could well be confessing to giving credence to pagan lore-a punishable confession, since Christianity was proclaimed the state religion almost one hundred years ago, as you know well.<br><br>I delivered a measured response. "I do, Your Eminence. Yet I also know that such prophecy is but heretical conjecture spoken by the masses."<br><br>Gallienus stared long at me, never blinking but keeping his eyes hooded in shadow such that I could not read his reaction. Then he nodded slowly and said, "That is true, Brother Decius. Still, we must be prepared."<br><br>"Of course, Your Eminence." Wary of this man, I was apprehensive of accusations that I had discounted the empire's military might with my answer. So I said, "Though the empire maintains a vast army."<br><br>"We cannot leave the fate of the Roman Christian Church to Emperor Anthemius's troops, can we, Brother Decius?"<br><br>Understanding that Gallienus's question brooked no response other than agreement, I said, "No, Your Eminence. We cannot leave the fate of the Roman Christian Church to the Roman army."<br><br>"I am glad we are of like mind, Brother Decius. Heartily glad."<br><br>I watched Gallienus saunter around the pope's chamber as if it belonged to him, pausing to touch the gilt arms of the papal throne and the intricate wall mosaic of birds in flight. As he gazed out between columns to the surging metropolis below, still crowded with marble temples and colonnaded forums dedicated to the pagan gods, despite the edict banning their worship, I waited for my mission.<br><br>"We must secure the land of the Gaels, Brother Decius," Gallienus pronounced without turning back toward me.<br><br>"The desolate isle beyond Britannia, Your Eminence?" My brother, I regretted the question the moment it slipped from my tongue. I knew, of course, where the Gaelic land lay, but I could not believe that the church would trouble itself with the unimportant, rocky outcropping on the precipice of the known world, an island so inconsequential that Rome did not bother to colonize it even in the Republic's prime. Not to mention that with Gael's lack of a central ruler, subduing its countless chieftains would have required more than fifty thousand troops, which Rome could ill afford due to mounting pressures on nearly all other frontiers. But I did not want the man to think I was a fool or, worse, an insubordinate in need of punishment.<br><br>"The very same," Gallenius answered, without rebuke or surprise at my response. He faced me. "Rumors are surfacing that its chieftains are uniting in power under the newly formed Christian monasteries. This news would be hailed-indeed, we always embrace new sheep in our flock- but for the reports that the Gaelic brand of Christianity is rife with heresy. We would not want Gael to unify under a Pelagian Christianity, now, would we? We must determine whether these reports bear truth."<br><br>Gallienus did not continue with any details, though, of course, I had long heard rumblings about Pelagius, the rebel monk from Britannia who had maintained that original sin does not exist and that man has free will, a belief condemned by the church's Council of Ephesus in 431.<br><br>"Would Bishop Patrick not be able to serve in this regard?" The Roman Christian Church had sent Patrick to Gael as a missionary some years before, in an unprecedented posting. The church had never before assigned a missionary to an uncolonized land, but Patrick had made constant, persuasive arguments about God calling him to convert the people who had once enslaved him.<br><br>"Inexplicably, Bishop Patrick is too enamored with the Gaelic people to report upon them objectively." Gallienus then made a broad gesture toward me.<br><br>I finished for him, as he clearly wished: "You would like me to make this appraisal, Your Eminence."<br><br>"Yes, Brother Decius. I wish you to study a particular abbey that grows in power, the Abbey of Kildare which is run by a woman, Brigid, no less." He paused and then asked, "Do you understand the critical importance of this work?"<br><br>"I welcome Your Eminence's wisdom." I felt the need to remain guarded in my responses, though I had begun to intuit his designs.<br><br>"If, in fact, the Gaelic monasteries and churches preach heresy as charged, we must stamp out the leaders of this profanation and replace them with our own. Only then can we unite this disjointed, backward land under the true Christian faith and present it as a tribute to the emperor. To help him bolster the empire and . . ." He left the sentence unfinished.<br><br>"And, in turn, bolster the church, Your Eminence?" He seemed to want me to say this aloud.<br><br>"You do see, Brother Decius. I am well pleased."<br><br>And see I did, when he put it so plainly. The Roman Church stands on increasingly unsteady ground as the Roman government falters. It needs to shore itself against the barbarian onslaught by routing out all heresy. Efforts to keep the remote island fully Roman Catholic could prevent it from becoming barbarian-and create a fitting honorarium for the Roman emperor in the process.<br><br>Gallienus sidled up near me, drawing so close that, despite the early hours, I could smell his sour, wine-laden breath. "Do you wonder at your selection for this task?"<br><br>I lowered my head, away from his probing stare and his stench. "I trust in the sagacity of God, Pope Simplicius, and his learned councillors, Your Eminence."<br><br>Gallienus smiled. "Always cautious, Brother Decius. Almost as cautious as myself. It will serve you well." The smile vanished, leaving an unpleasant grimace on his lips. "We chose you not for your ardent faith or your private hatred of the barbarians, though you have both of these excellent qualities in abundance. We chose you because we need a scribe."<br><br>My dear brother, the light fades, and the horses assemble for the long journey. I have not the time to complete the description of my encounter with Gallienus or my mission to the Gaelic land, though I suspect you would reel at the notion of your pious, careful younger brother, whom you always protected as you dashed off on some adventure of your own design, heading off into the dark unknown. I pray with fervence to our Lord that He will deliver unto me the means to transport this letter to you. Until then, I will be in His hands. Pray for me, brother, as I pray for you.<br><br><i>Decius<br><br>ii<br><br>Gael<br><br>a.d. 456<br><br>brigid: a life<br></i><br>Brigid readies her sword. She sizes up her competitor and fashions a fresh strategy. The call to battle sounds, and they rush at each other headlong.<br><br>The metallic shriek of their locked swords overtakes the battlefield. Brigid begins with a thrust and parry so they will seem even matched. But she knows her combatant well, and her standard swordplay serves as a trap. The rhythmic clash of their blades lulls him into thinking he commands the lead and wipes any strategy from his overconfident mind. She lures him to the edge of a ditch bordering the field and prepares her final strike.<br><br>An almost imperceptible tremor passes through the watching soldiers. Brigid averts her gaze momentarily and sees that her father has arrived. A faint smile curls on her lips as she thinks about the fortune of having her father watch her victory. She shifts her weight to muster all her force for the winning thrust.<br><br>But her competitor marks her fleeting distraction and subtly changes his position. When Brigid swings forward with all her might, she stumbles to the ground in pain and embarrassment. It is her opponent who delivers the ultimate blow-not Brigid.<br><br>She rises under her own strength, pushing aside her competitor's outstretched hand. If she must fall to another's sword, she will prove to her father that she can shrug off a blow as easily as his fiercest warriors. Brushing away a servant's attempt to dress her shoulder wound, Brigid passes her blade back into the scabbard hanging from a loop off her metal belt. She unrolls the hem of her long robe, which she had tucked into her belt, and strides off the field as if she had won.<br><br>Brigid glances in her father's direction. She hopes he has observed her stoicism, if not her victory. But he is gone, leaving her to wonder just what he witnessed.<br><br>She curses to herself as the crowd dissipates. Her overeagerness had caused her fatal misstep, one only a rank beginner would commit. She is furious with herself.<br><br>"Ach, don't beat yourself up about it, Brigid. Everyone knows you've got better sword skills than me."<br><br>She turns toward the voice. It is her opponent, her foster brother, Oengus, who has been sheltered by her family since the age of seven, according to Gaelic custom. He will return to his own family at seventeen, taking the newly made bond with him as a tie to his own family. "Easy for you to say. You just won to a warrior's crowd of a hundred, with my father at the center."<br><br>Oengus does not respond. Wisely, Brigid thinks. For she knows-and he knows-that she is right, that her father expects her to dominate in every respect. Even on the battlefield against a man. For her father is Dubtach, king of the Fothairt people of southern Gael, and he demands nothing less of his only natural child.<br><br>The long walk across the crop fields to the stone cashel ringing the royal homestead lessens her inner anger. As they pass the cattle and sheep fields, she forgets her troubles for a moment and unconsciously counts the animals' heads: they are the measure of her father's power, along with the slaves captured by raiding parties. By the time they cross the rampart over the ditch encircling the inner wall of the cashel, Brigid has even mustered a laugh at Oengus's imitation of their instructor, an aging warrior of her father's. Oengus alone can make her laugh. At their approach to the two vast earthen mounds used by Dubtach for his ceremonies, she is able to pretend that she has forgotten about her humiliation. But she never really forgets.<br><br>Brigid and Oengus near the large heather-thatched building used for their studies. Though they are well ahead of their appointed time, they notice a number of unfamiliar people entering the structure. Brigid picks up her pace, pushes open the heavy oak door, and enters with Oengus hard at her heels.<br><br>"Fresh from the battlefield, I see?"<br><br>Brigid's eyes adjust slowly from the bright spring light to the dim interior. She does not need to see the face to recognize the speaker. It is her mother, Broicsech, queen of the Fothairt people, and from her tone, Brigid understands that she is fuming.</p><h2>Ellie Herman&#39;s Pilates Reformer, Third Edition</h2><p>Finally a complete manual for the Universal Pilates Reformer by San Francisco Pilates expert Ellie Herman.

Called to love God with all that we are. Called to serve Him. Called to reach out to the lost. However, if we are honest, the majority of us would admit that we find this last calling the most difficult. While we gladly support the evangelistic ministries of others, many of us feel discouraged by our own attempts at witnessing because our memorized approaches don&#39;t seem to work. This biblical study of evangelism gracefully reminds us that the New Testament model of witnessing is not a one - size - fits - all methodology. With compassion for the lost filling every page, Jerram Barrs shows the variety of approaches used in the New Testament - where the same uncompromised Gospel was packaged as differently as the audience - and calls you to follow its example. You can learn to witness comfortably in your particular circumstances so that sharing Christ doesn&#39;t feel like a chore. And as you watch God work in the lives of others and see the great blessings He brings, you&#39;ll discover what a privilege it is to live out the heart of evangelism: truly loving others to Christ.</p><p>Jerram Barrs (MDiv, Covenant Theological Seminary) is the founder and resident scholar of the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute at Covenant Theological Seminary, where he teaches apologetics and outreach as professor of Christianity and contemporary culture. He and his wife also served on staff at English L&#x2019;Abri for many years. He is the author of Learning Evangelism from Jesus and Echoes of Eden.</p><h2>Cigars: A Guide</h2><p><p>Exploring not just the extraordinary story of tobacco and cigars but also a history that has been instrumental in the foundations of societies and cultures, <i>Cigars</i> will take you on an astonishing journey through landscapes, scents, and an incredible roll call of the great, the good and the not-so good.

They usually spend all the new money they are earning. It is great to have the new earnings vehicle, but it is still futile without learning how to be smart with your money. Until you understand money and how to attract it, keep and grow it, you are likely to just spin your wheels spending every dollar that comes in the door. Money Mindset will be your ticket to the wealth-building fast lane and is a MUST READ for every network marketer on the planet.</p><p>Prior to becoming the pace-setter for the 300,000+ associates in his network marketing business, Brian enjoyed a successful career in real estate. I was working 6-7 days a week, 8 to faint, in real estate. I was making good money, but had no time freedom. When I saw the network marketing model, I recognized there might be a better path for me. In under three years, by the age of 30, Brian made his first million dollars in his network marketing business. He went on to build an empire that has generated a 7-figure annual income for more than ten straight years. Brian Carruthers has become a success coach, helping people to dream again ... then helping them to achieve their dreams. He has already helped thousands of his business associates to become successful business owners, get out of the corporate world rat-race, and begin to spend real time with their families doing the things that are really important to them. Brian loves to help people, and gives of himself to that end every day. What s special about Brian is that he is still in the trenches with people. He didn t get to the top and then become a manager of people, but rather he chooses to keep leading from the front by true example. You won t hear Brian teaching theories he heard from others. Instead you will hear him say, Here s what worked that I just did this morning. Don t worry about the money, Brian says. Help enough people get what they want out of life, and you will be taken care of in a big way. Just keep investing in yourself, and encourage others to do the same. Brian explains that those who have the hunger to learn, grow, and become better will find what they need to win. Seeking knowledge from the masters is imperative. Brian sought out the very best in his field and industry, learned from them, then applied those principles and philosophies to develop the fastest growing and most successful team of entrepreneurs in the U.S. Brian has been touted by national organizations and business publications as the real deal (see Home Business magazine). His three books in the last four years have all become best sellers. Becoming such a success by this young age was not just a dream, it was his expectation. What you expect happens , adds Brian. Now Brian s goal is to create thousands of new success stories. As our profession grows, and the people in it grow, so will their incomes.</p><h2>Mere Christianity</h2><p><p><b>Special 65th Anniversary Edition</b></p><p>One of the most popular and beloved introductions to the concept of faith ever written, &#x2018;Mere Christianity&#x2019; has sold millions of copies worldwide.</p><p>The book brings together C.S. Lewis&#x2019;s legendary radio broadcasts during the war years, in which he set out simply to &#x2018;explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times&#x2019;.</p><p>Rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity&#x2019;s many denominations, <em>Mere Christianity</em> provides an unequalled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to absorb a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.</p></p><p>In 1943 Great Britain, when hope and the moral fabric of society were threatened by the relentless inhumanity of global war, an Oxford don was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. Over half a century after the original lectures, the topic retains it urgency. Expanded into book form, <i>Mere Christianity</i> never flinches as it sets out a rational basis for Christianity and builds an edifice of compassionate morality atop this foundation. As Mr. Lewis clearly demonstrates, Christianity is not a religion of flitting angels and blind faith, but of free will, an innate sense of justice and the grace of God.<p>In 1941 England, when all hope was threatened by the inhumanity of war, C. S. Lewis was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. More than half a century later, these talks continue to retain their poignancy. First heard as informal radio broadcasts on the BBC, the lectures were published as three books and subsequently combined as <em>Mere Christianity</em>. C. S. Lewis proves that "at the center of each there is something, or a Someone, who against all divergences of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks with the same voice," rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity's many denominations. This twentieth century masterpiece provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith.</p><p>With a new foreword by Lewis's stepson, Douglas Gresham, this illustrated gift edition evokes the historic time and place of the book's creation.</p></p><h2>The Dogma of Hell</h2><p>The doctrine of hell is one of the four last things. Father Schouppe gives a terrifying presentation of this doctrine that will inspire people to avoid this horrible place and to save their soul. We need to study this truth carefully so that we realize just how important it is to become a Saint. Let us consider this story: The following incident happened in 1837. A young under-lieutenant, being in Paris, entered the Church of the Assumption, near the Toilers, and saw a priest kneeling near a confessional. As he made religion the habitual subject of his jokes, he wished to go to confession to while away the time, and went into the confessional. &#34;Monsieur l&#39;abb�,&#34; he said, &#34;would you be good enough to hear my confession?&#34; &#34;Willingly my son; confess unrestrained.&#34; &#34;But I must first say that I am a rather unique kind of a sinner.&#34; &#34;No matter; the sacrament of penance has been instituted for all sinners.&#34; &#34;But I am not very much of a believer in religious matters.&#34; &#34;You believe more than you think.&#34; &#34;Believe? I? I am a regular scoffer.&#34; The confessor saw with whom he had to deal, and that there was some mystification. He replied, smiling: &#34;You are a regular scoffer? Are you then making fun of me too?&#34; The pretended penitent smiled in like manner. &#34;Listen,&#34; the priest went on, &#34;what you have just done here is not serious. Let us leave confession aside; and, if you please, have a little chat. I like military people greatly; and, then, you have the appearance of a good, amiable youth. Tell me, what is your rank?&#34; &#34;Under-lieutenant.&#34; &#34;Will you remain an under-lieutenant long?&#34; &#34;Two, three, perhaps four years.&#34; &#34;And after?&#34; &#34;I shall hope to become a lieutenant?&#34; &#34;And after?&#34; &#34;I hope to become a captain.&#34; &#34;And after?&#34; &#34;Lieutenant-colonel?&#34; &#34;How old will you be then?&#34; &#34;Forty to forty-five years.&#34; &#34;And after that?&#34; &#34;I shall become a brigadier general.&#34; &#34;And after?&#34; &#34;If I rise higher, I shall be general of a division.&#34; &#34;And after?&#34; &#34;After! there is nothing more except the Marshal&#39;s baton; but my pretensions do not reach so high.&#34; &#34;Well and good. But do you intend to get married?&#34; &#34;Yes, when I shall be a superior officer.&#34; &#34;Well! There you are married; a superior officer, a general, perhaps even a French marshal, who knows? And after?&#34; &#34;After? Upon my word, I do not know what will be after.&#34; &#34;See, how strange it is!&#34; said the abb�. Then, in a tone of voice that grew more sober: &#34;You know all that shall happen up to that point, and you do not know what will be after. Well, I know, and I am going to tell you, After, you shall die, be judged, and, if you continue to live as you do, you shall be damned, you shall go and burn in hell; that is what will be after.&#34; As the under-lieutenant, dispirited at this conclusion, seemed anxious to steal away: &#34;One moment, sir,&#34; said the abb�. &#34;You are a man of honor. So am I. Agree that you have offended me, and owe me an apology. It will be simple. For eight days, before retiring to rest, you will say: &#39;One day I shall die; but I laugh at the idea. After my death I shall be judged; but I laugh at the idea. After my judgment, I shall be damned; but I laugh at the idea. I shall burn forever in hell; but I laugh at the idea!&#39; That is all. But you are going to give me your word of honor not to neglect it, eh?&#34; More and more wearied, and wishing, at any price, to extricate himself from this false step, the under-lieutenant made the promise. In the evening, his word being given, he began to carry out his promise. &#34;I shall die,&#34; he says. &#34;I shall be judged.&#34; He had not the courage to add: &#34;I laugh at the idea.&#34; The week had not passed before he returned to the Church of the Assumption, made his confession seriously, and came out of the confessional his face bathed with tears, and with joy in his heart.</p><p>The eminent French theologian, Fr. F.X. Schouppe, S.J., (Purgatory Explained by the Lives and <p> Legends of the Saints), has written here a similar book on the subject of Hell. While the basic Catholic doctrines on Hell are reviewed, he mainly recounts numerous true stories that reinforce belief in Hell and the eternity of its horrors. The subject of Hell is frightening but the purpose of this work is not sensationalistic or to terrify, but rather to present lucidly to readers the reality of Hell and to instill in them a firm dread of the loss of Heaven. </p><p> We trust that reading this short volume will motivate many in their faith, bring others back to God and help people truly desire Salvation.</p>Father F.X. Schouppe, S.J. was an eminent theologian of the nineteenth century. He was the author of <i>Purgatory Explained by the Lives and Legends of the Saints</i> and <i>The Dogma of Hell</i>. His purpose with the latter work, though the subject itself is terrifying, was not to sensationalize or to horrify; but rather to instruct people on the reality of Hell and to excite them to a dread of losing Heaven. <i>The Dogma of Hell</i> was originally published in 1883 by P.V. Hickey, and <i>Purgatory Explained</i> was printed in the late 1800s with the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur.</p><h2>Learning from the Stranger: Christian Faith and Cultural Diversity</h2><p>Cultural differences increasingly impact our everyday lives. Virtually none of us today interact exclusively with people who look, talk, and behave like we do. David Smith here offers an excellent guide to living and learning in our culturally interconnected world. / Learning from the Stranger clearly explains what "culture" is, discusses how cultural difference affects our perceptions and behavior, and explores how Jesus' call to love our neighbor involves learning from cultural strangers. Built around three chapter-length readings of extended biblical passages (from Genesis, Luke, and Acts), the book skillfully weaves together theological and practical concerns, and Smith&#x2019;s engaging, readable text is peppered with stories from his own extensive firsthand experience. / Many thoughtful readers will resonate with this insightful book as it encourages the virtues of humility and hospitality in our personal interactions &#x2015; and shows how learning from strangers, not just imparting our own ideas to them, is an integral part of Christian discipleship.</p><p>David I. Smith is director of the Kuyers Institute for Christian Teaching and Learning, Calvin College, and associate professor of German at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan.<b>Terry A. Osborn&nbsp;</b><br> &#x2014; Fordham University<br> "What I so admire about the work of David Smith is his unique ability to take the complexities of postmodern scholarship and translate them with clarity for contemporary students. In&nbsp;<i>Learning from the Stranger</i>&nbsp;Smith tackles the elusive and ubiquitous 'culture,' exploring how those of us committed to living for Christ must grapple with our own conceptualizations of the stranger as a way of understanding who we are and how we interact with those around us. Important reading for today's college students."<br><br><b>Sherwood Lingenfelter</b><br> &#x2014; Fuller Theological Seminary<br> "A radically different introduction to the study of language and culture from a Christian theological perspective. . . Smith's most powerful argument is that learning other languages and cultures is a task for ordinary Americans, not just those who hope to serve as cross-cultural missionaries. . . I recommend this book as an excellent, theologically grounded introduction to cultural learning for use in courses on cultural diversity in Christian colleges and other faith-based communities."</p><h2>An: To Eat: Recipes and Stories from a Vietnamese Family Kitchen</h2><p><p>In Vietnamese, AN&#x201d; means TO EAT,&#x201d; a happy coincidence, since the An family has built an award-winning restaurant empire including the renowned celebrity favorite Crustacean Beverly Hills that has been toasted by leading food press, including <i>Bon App�tit, Gourmet, InStyle</i> and the Food Network.

Just let it go.&#x201d;</p><p>Not only could they hear the music blaring from next door; they could feel it. The deep bass was pulsing through the walls of their house like a heartbeat.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s eleven o&#x2019;clock, for Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; Richard said, turning on his bedside table lamp. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s Wednesday. Not Friday night or Saturday night, but Wednesday.&#x201d;</p><p>The Bradleys had lived in this modest Milford home, on this hundred-year-old street with its mature trees, for nearly thirty years. They&#x2019;d seen neighbors come and go. The good, and the bad. But never had there been anything as bad as this, and it had been going on for a while. Two years back, the owner of the house next door started renting it to students attending Housatonic Community College over in Bridgeport, and since then the neighborhood had gone, as Richard Bradley liked to proclaim on a daily basis, &#x201c;to hell in a handcart.&#x201d;</p><p>Some of the students had been worse than others. This bunch, they took the cake. Loud music nearly every night. The smell of marijuana wafting in through the windows. Shattered beer bottles on the sidewalk.</p><p>This used to be a nice part of town. Young couples with their first homes, some starting families. There were some older teenagers on the street, to be sure, but if any of them acted up, threw a raucous party when they were left on their own, at least you could rat them out the next day to their parents and it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again. At least not for a while. There were older people on the street, too, many of them retired. Like the Bradleys, who&#x2019;d taught in schools in and around Milford since the 1970s before packing it in.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that what we worked so hard for our whole lives?&#x201d; he asked Esther. &#x201c;So we could live next door to a bunch of goddamn rabble-rousers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll stop soon,&#x201d; she said, sitting up in bed. &#x201c;They usually do at some point. We were young, too, once.&#x201d; She grimaced. &#x201c;A long time ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like an earthquake that won&#x2019;t end,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what the hell kind of music that is. What is that?&#x201d;</p><p>He stood up, grabbed his bathrobe, which was thrown over a chair, knotted the sash in front.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to give yourself a heart attack,&#x201d; Esther said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go over every time this happens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back in a couple of minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; she said as he strode out of the bedroom. Esther Bradley threw back the covers, put on her own robe, slid her feet into the slippers on the floor by the bed, and went running down the stairs after her husband.</p><p>By the time she caught up with him, he was on the front porch. She noticed, for the first time, that he had nothing on his feet. She tried to grab his arm to stop him but he jerked it away, and she felt a twinge of pain in her shoulder. He went down the steps, walked down to the sidewalk, turned left, and kept marching until he reached the driveway next door. He could have taken a shortcut across the grass, but it was still wet from a shower earlier in the evening.</p><p>&#x201c;Richard,&#x201d; she said pleadingly, a few steps behind him. She wasn&#x2019;t going to leave him alone. She figured there was less likelihood that these young men would do anything to him if they saw her standing there. Would they punch out an old man while his wife watched?</p><p>He was a man on a mission, mounting the steps to the front door of the three-story Victorian home. Most of the lights were on, many of the windows open, the music blaring out for all the neighbors to hear. But it wasn&#x2019;t loud enough to drown out the sounds of raised voices and laughter.</p><p>Richard banged on the door, his wife stationed at the bottom of the porch steps, watching anxiously.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to say?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>He ignored her and banged on the door again. He was about to strike it with the heel of his fist a third time when the door swung open. A thin man, maybe twenty, just over six feet tall, dressed in jeans and a plain dark blue T-shirt and holding a can of Coors in his hand, stood there.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said. He blinked woozily a couple of times as he sized up his visitor. Bradley&#x2019;s few wisps of gray hair were sticking up at all angles, his bathrobe had started to part in front, and his eyes were bugging out.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; Bradley shouted.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; the man said, bewildered.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re keeping up the whole damn neighborhood!&#x201d;</p><p>The man&#x2019;s mouth formed an O, as if trying to take it in. He looked beyond the man and saw Esther Bradley, holding her hands together, almost in prayer.</p><p>She said, sounding almost apologetic, &#x201c;The music is a bit loud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah, shit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re from next door, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Richard said, shaking his head. &#x201c;I was over here last week, and the week before that! You got any brain cells left?&#x201d;</p><p>The young man blinked a couple more times, then turned and shouted back into the house, &#x201c;Hey, turn it down. Carter! Hey, Carter! Turn it&#x2014;yeah, turn it the fuck down, will ya!&#x201d;</p><p>Three seconds later, the music stopped, the sudden silence jarring.</p><p>The young man shrugged apologetically, said, &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; He extended his free hand. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Brian. Or have I told you that before?&#x201d;</p><p>Richard Bradley ignored the hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to come in for a beer or something?&#x201d; Brian asked, cheerily raising the bottle in his hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got some pizza, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Richard said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for the offer,&#x201d; Esther said cheerily.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re, like, the people in that house, right?&#x201d; Brian asked, pointing.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Esther said.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Well, sorry about the noise and everything. We all had this test today and we were kind of unwinding, you know? If we get out of hand again, just come over and bang on the door and we&#x2019;ll try to dial it down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve been doing,&#x201d; Richard said. </p><p>Brian shrugged, then slipped back into the house and closed the door.</p><p>Esther said, &#x201c;He seems like a nice young man.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard grunted.</p><p>They returned to their house, the front door slightly ajar from when they&#x2019;d run out of it in a hurry. It wasn&#x2019;t until they were both inside and had closed and bolted the door, that they noticed the two people sitting in the living room.</p><p>A man and woman. Late thirties, early forties. Both smartly dressed in jeans&#x2014;was that a crease in hers?&#x2014;and lightweight jackets.</p><p>Esther let out a short, startled scream when she spotted them.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; Richard said. &#x201c;How the hell did you&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t leave your door open like that,&#x201d; said the woman, getting up from the couch. She wasn&#x2019;t much more than five-two, maybe five-three. Short black hair, worn in a bob. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not smart,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even in a nice neighborhood like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Call the police,&#x201d; Richard Bradley said to his wife.</p><p>It took a moment for the command to register. But when it did, she started for the kitchen. The moment she moved, the man shot up off the couch. He was a good foot taller than the woman, stocky, and swift. He crossed the room in an instant and blocked her path.</p><p>He grabbed her roughly by her bony shoulders, spun her around, and tossed her, hard, into a living room chair.</p><p>She yelped.</p><p>&#x201c;You son of a bitch!&#x201d; Richard Bradley said and charged at the man while he was turned away from him. He made a fist and pounded it into the intruder&#x2019;s back, just below the neck. The man spun around and swatted Richard away as if he was a child. As he stumbled back, the man glanced down, saw Richard&#x2019;s bare foot, and drove the heel of his shoe down onto it.</p><p>Bradley shouted out in pain and collapsed toward the couch, catching the edge and falling onto the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; the woman said. She said to her partner, &#x201c;Sweetheart, you want to turn down some of these lights? It&#x2019;s awfully bright in here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said, found the light switch, and flicked it down.</p><p>&#x201c;My foot,&#x201d; Richard whimpered. &#x201c;You broke my goddamn foot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me help him,&#x201d; Esther said. &#x201c;Let me get him an ice pack.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stay put,&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>The woman perched her butt on the edge of the coffee table, where she could easily address Esther or look down to the floor to Richard.</p><p>She said this:</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask the two of you a question, and I&#x2019;m only going to ask it once. So I want you to <i>listen</i> very carefully, and then I want you to <i>think</i> very carefully about how you answer. What I do not want you to do is answer my question with a question. That would be very, very unproductive. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>The Bradleys glanced at each other, terrified, then looked back at the woman. Their heads bobbed up and down weakly in understanding.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very good,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;So, pay attention. It&#x2019;s a very simple question.&#x201d;</p><p>The Bradleys waited.</p><p>The woman said, &#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d;</p><p>The words hung there for a moment, no one making a sound.</p><p>After several seconds, Richard said, &#x201c;Where is wh&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>Then cut himself off when he saw the look in the woman&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>She smiled and waved a finger at him. &#x201c;Tut, tut, I warned you about that. You almost did it, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Richard swallowed. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you answer the question? Again, you need to know that Eli says it&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard&#x2019;s lips trembled. He shook his head and stammered, &#x201c;I&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The woman raised a palm, silencing him, and turned her attention to Esther. &#x201c;Would you like to answer the question?&#x201d;</p><p>Esther was careful with her phrasing. &#x201c;I would appreciate it if you could be more specific. I&#x2014;I have to tell you that name&#x2014;Eli? I don&#x2019;t know anyone by that name. Whatever it is you want, if we have it, we&#x2019;ll give it to you.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman sighed and turned her head to her partner, who was standing a couple of feet away.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you your chance,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;I told you I&#x2019;d only ask once.&#x201d; Just then, the house next door began to thump once again with loud music. The windows of the Bradley house began to vibrate. The woman smiled and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Drake. I like him.&#x201d; She glanced up at the man and said, &#x201c;Shoot the husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! No!&#x201d; Esther screamed.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; Richard shouted. &#x201c;Just tell us what&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Before the retired teacher could finish the sentence, the man had reached into his jacket for a gun, pointed it downward, and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Esther opened her mouth to scream again, but no sound came out. Little more than a high-pitched squeak, as though someone had stepped on a mouse.</p><p>The woman said to her, &#x201c;I guess you really don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; She nodded at her associate, and he fired a second shot.</p><p>Wearily, she said to him, &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s not here. We&#x2019;ve got a long night ahead of us, sweetheart, unless it&#x2019;s in the cookie jar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We should be so lucky,&#x201d; he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>TERRY</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know where I got the idea that once you&#x2019;ve come through a very dark time, after you&#x2019;ve confronted the worst possible demons and defeated them, that everything&#x2019;s going to be just fine.</p><p>Doesn&#x2019;t work that way.</p><p>Not that life wasn&#x2019;t better for us, at least for a while. Seven years ago, things were pretty bad around here. Bad as they can get. People died. My wife and daughter and I came close to being among them. But when it was over, and we were whole, and still had each other, well, we did like the song says. We picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and started all over again.</p><p>More or less.</p><p>But the scars remained. We went through our own version of post-traumatic stress. My wife, Cynthia, certainly did. She&#x2019;d lost all the members of her family when she was fourteen&#x2014;I really mean <i>lost</i>; her parents and her brother vanished into thin air one night&#x2014;and Cynthia had to wait twenty-five years to learn their fate. When it was all over, there were no joyful reunions.</p><p>There was more. Cynthia&#x2019;s aunt paid the ultimate price in her bid to shine the light on a decades-old secret. And then there was Vince Fleming, a career criminal who was also just a kid when Cynthia&#x2019;s family vanished, who&#x2019;d been with her that night. Twenty-five years later, against his own nature, he helped us find out what really happened. Like they say, no good deed goes unpunished. He got shot and nearly died for his trouble.</p><p>You might have heard about it. It was all over the news. They were even going to make a movie about it at one point, but that fell through, which, if you ask me, was for the best.</p><p>We thought we&#x2019;d be able to close the book on that chapter of our lives. Questions were answered; mysteries were solved. The bad people died, or went to prison.</p><p>Case closed, as they say.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s like a horrible tsunami. You think it&#x2019;s over, but debris is washing ashore half a world away years later.</p><p>For Cynthia, the trauma never ended. Every day, she feared history repeating itself with the family she had now. Me. And our daughter, Grace. The trouble was, the steps she took to make sure it wouldn&#x2019;t led us into that area known as the law of unintended consequence: the actions you take to achieve one thing often produce the exact opposite result.</p><p>Cynthia&#x2019;s efforts to keep our fourteen-year-old daughter, Grace, safe from the big, bad world were pushing the child to experience it as quickly as she could.</p><p>I kept hoping we&#x2019;d eventually work our way through the darkness and come out the other side. But it didn&#x2019;t look as though it was going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>GRACE and her mother had shouting matches on a pretty much daily basis.</p><p>They were all variations on a theme.</p><p>Grace ignored curfew. Grace didn&#x2019;t call when she got to where she was going. Grace said she was going to one friend&#x2019;s house but ended up going to another and didn&#x2019;t update her mother. Grace wanted to go to a concert in New York but wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get home until two in the morning. Mom said no.</p><p>I tried to be a peacemaker in these disputes, usually with little success. I&#x2019;d tell Cynthia privately that I understood her motives, that I didn&#x2019;t want anything bad to happen to Grace, either, but that if our daughter was never allowed any freedom, she&#x2019;d never learn to cope in the world on her own.</p><p>These fights generally ended with someone storming out of a room. A door being slammed. Grace telling Cynthia she hated her, then knocking over a chair as she left the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;God, she&#x2019;s just like me,&#x201d; Cynthia would often say. &#x201c;I was a horror show at that age. I just don&#x2019;t want her making the same mistakes I made.&#x201d;</p><p>Cynthia, even now, thirty-two years later, carried a lot of guilt from the night her mother and father and older brother, Todd, disappeared. Part of her still believed that if she hadn&#x2019;t been out with a boy named Vince, without her parents&#x2019; permission or knowledge, and if she hadn&#x2019;t gotten drunk and passed out once she&#x2019;d fallen into her own bed, she might have known what was happening and, somehow, saved those closest to her.</p><p>Even though the facts didn&#x2019;t bear that out, Cynthia believed she&#x2019;d been...</p></p><h2>Music to My Years: A Mixtape Memoir of Growing Up and Standing Up</h2><p><b>In this memoir full of humor and heart, comedian, writer, and producer Cristela Alonzo shares personal stories of growing up as a first-generation Mexican-American in Texas and following her dreams to pursue a career in comedy. </b><br><br>When Cristela Alonzo and her family lived as squatters in an abandoned diner, they only had two luxuries: a television and a radio, which became her pop cultural touchstone and a guiding light. <br> <br>Cristela shares her experiences and struggles of being a first-generation American, her dreams of becoming a comedian, and how it feels to be a creator in a world that often minimizes people of color and women. Her stories range from the ridiculous&#x2014;like the time she made her own tap shoes out of bottle caps or how the theme song of <i>The Golden Girls </i>landed her in the principal&#x2019;s office&#x2014;to the sobering moments, like how she turned to stand-up comedy to grieve the heartbreaking loss of her mother and how, years later, she&#x2019;s committed to giving back to the community that helped make her.<br> <br>Each significant moment of the book relates to a song, and the resulting playlist is deeply moving, resonant, and unforgettable. <i>Music to My Years </i>will make you laugh, cry, and even inspire you to make a playlist of your own.</p><p>Cristela Alonzo is a comedian, actor, and producer. She was the first Latina to create, produce, and star in her own network sitcom, Cristela. She became the first Latina lead in a Disney Pixar film, <i>Cars 3</i>. Alonzo&#x2019;s stand-up special, <i>Lower Classy</i>, can be streamed on Netflix. Cristela is an advisory board member for the nonprofit media and culture organization, Define American, and a board member for La Union del Pueblo Entero (LUPE), founded by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. She lives in Los Angeles.&#x201c;If Chance the Rapper and Cristela the Comedian had a baby, it would be this book. Cristela&#x2019;s memoir is an emotional journey that will make you laugh, cry, and everything in between. As the first Latina woman to create, produce, write, and star in her own prime-time show and who found success despite all the challenges she faced, Cristela will have you continually rooting for her. Also, all the songs she name-drops are real bops.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Wanda Skyes</b><br><br>&#x201c;Cristela&#x2019;s real life evolved into her comedy and her comedy informed her sense of right and wrong&#x2014;but more than anything, Cristela has remained real and funny. Read the book. You&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Whoopi Goldberg</b><br><br>&#x201c;Cristela brings her signature humor to bear as she offers a brilliant and touching reflection on how the personal is political. It is no coincidence that after ruminating on themes that include identity, representation, and inequality, she caps off the book with a fierce defense of our democracy and the people whom it is meant to serve. I was inspired by her story of political awakening and hope others will read this and deepen their own political activism.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Juli�n Castro</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>I loved the book</i>. Cristela vividly enlightens, educates, and entertains us on her hard journey from the poverty and culture of the Mexico-Texas border to stardom, honestly sharing her life lessons and the music that sustained her. [This is] a story that will guide us to want to be as strong, compassionate, and visionary as she is for family, friends, and country. Music is such a big part of one&#x2019;s life. When we stood on the picket lines, we sang &#x2018;We Shall Overcome&#x2019; and &#x2018;This Little Light of Mine&#x2019; a thousand times from the early morning till the strikebreakers left the fields. There is so much to say about the book, it affirmed my life in many ways, as I am sure it will for so many Latinas. We are alike.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Dolores Huerta</b><br><br>&#x201c;Alonzo crafts a humorous writing style that feels like an intimate conversation with readers. The jokes jump off the page and provide an emotional relief to the harsh realities of hardship and poverty she experienced. Alonzo&#x2019;s memoir is a timely reminder that regardless of economic status, race, or gender, love is the connection that ties together all humanity.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><b>Booklist</b></i></p><h2>Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell (In a Nutshell, 14)</h2><p><p>This unique textbook provides an accessible introduction to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a subject of breathtaking beauty and supreme importance in physics.

A. Scotti traces the defining event of a glorious epoch: the building of St. Peter?s Basilica. Begun by the ferociously ambitious Pope Julius II in 1506, the endeavor would span two tumultuous centuries, challenge the greatest Renaissance masters?Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bramante?and enrage Martin Luther. By the time it was completed, Shakespeare had written all of his plays, the <i>Mayflower</i> had reached Plymouth?and Rome had risen with its astounding basilica to become Europe?s holy metropolis. A dazzling portrait of human achievement and excess, <i>Basilica</i> is a triumph of historical writing.</p><p>R. A. Scotti is the author of two previous works of nonfiction, including <b>Sudden Sea: The Great Hurricane of 1938</b>, and four novels.Anyone who sees the spectacular Basilica of St. Peter in Rome is awestruck by its sheer size and grandeur but may not be aware of the dramatic history of its creation. The construction of St. Peter's spanned 30 popes and more than 100 years, and its controversial financing provoked the Protestant Reformation. Some of history's best architects and artists, including Raphael, Bramante, Bernini, and a reluctant Michelangelo contributed their creative genius. Josephine Bailey's sophisticated voice is ideal for this earthly tale of power, money, and artistic brilliance. The Italian names and phrases trip gracefully off her tongue, and she smoothly delivers both the glorious and the dark sides of St. Peter's history.

Breen</p><h2>Break Through: Why We Can&#39;t Leave Saving the Planet to Environmentalists</h2><p>Current tactics can&#x2019;t solve today&#x2019;s complex global crises. The &#x201c;bad boys of environmentalism&#x201d; call for a bold and empowering new vision<br><br> Environmental insiders Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus triggered a firestorm of controversy with their self-published essay &#x201c;The Death of Environmentalism,&#x201d; which argued that environmentalism cannot deal with global warming and should die so that a new politics can be born. Global warming is far more complex than past pollution problems, and American values have changed dramatically since the movement&#x2019;s greatest victories in the 1960s, but environmentalists keep fighting the same old battles. Seeing a connection between the failures of environmentalism and the failures of the entire left-leaning political agenda, the authors point the way toward an aspirational politics that will resonate with modern American values and be capable of tackling our most pressing challenges.<br><br> In this eagerly awaited follow-up to the original essay, the authors give us an expansive and eloquent manifesto for political change. What Americans really want, and what could serve as the basis for a new politics, is a vision capable of inspiring us to greatness. Making the case for abandoning old categories (nature/market, left/right), the authors articulate a pragmatism fit for our times that has already found champions in such prominent figures as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.<br><br> This book will hit the same nerve as <i>What&#x2019;s the Matter with Kansas</i> and <i>Don&#x2019;t Think of an Elephant</i>. But its analysis will reshape American politics for decades to come.</p><p><p>Michael Shellenberger is an American author, environmental policy expert, and the president of The Breakthrough Institute.</p><br>"BREAK THROUGH helps to structure a much needed political dialogue of possibility.&#x201d; - Richard Florida, Rise of the Creative Class<br><br> BREAK THROUGH illuminates a new and empowering politics for America.&#x201d; Ross Gelbspan, "The Heat Is On" and "Boiling Point"<br><br>"A bracing manifesto sure to launch a debate long overdue in the environmental movement.&#x201d; Michael Pollan, "The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma"<br><br> BREAK THROUGH is a must-read.&#x201d; Ariel Levy, author of "Female Chauvinist Pigs"<br><br>"BREAK THROUGH is a provacative case against an erstwhile declaration of defeat." - Seed Magazine<br><br>"Could turn out to be the best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.&#x2019;" - Wired Magazine<br><br> Unremittingly interesting, sharp, and wide-ranging provides a great deal of thoughtful comment.&#x201d; - Bill McKibben New York Review of Books<br><br>"BREAK THROUGH is a provocative case against an erstwhile declaration of defeat." -Seed Magazine<br><br>"An urgent, engaging work ...

Alarming rumors are circulating, among them the fear that the village school may close. The endearing schoolmistress Miss Read brings her inimitable blend of affection and clear-sighted candor to this report, in which a young girl finds her first love, an older woman accepts a new role in life, and the impassioned battle to save the village from being engulfed is at the forefront of every villager&#39;s mind.</p><p><p><b>Miss Read</b> (1913-2012) was the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.</p>Residents of the English village of Fairacre are twittering with rumors of a large housing development which may be built on their rolling downs. Anne Rosenfeld presents the back-chat and gossip among the village characters with a precise English soprano that should add verbal dimension to Miss Read&#39;s cozy prose. Though the timbre of Rosenfeld&#39;s voice captures the atmosphere of the story, her uniformly high pitch is difficult to follow. The vocal changes of characters are so subtle as to cause confusion about who is talking. Some fans of Miss Read&#39;s light touch may be disappointed by the unrelieved shrillness of this presentation. B.V.

Everyone in school thinks she&#x2019;s weird, especially the girls in her Flower Scouts troop. Is it so weird to think scouting should be about fun and adventure, not about makeovers and boys, boys, boys?</p><p>But everything changes when Avani is &#x201c;accidentally&#x201d; abducted by a spunky alien named Mabel. Mabel is a scout too&#x2015;a Star Scout. Collecting alien specimens (like Avani) goes with the territory, along with teleportation and jetpack racing. Avani might be weird, but in the Star Scouts she fits right in. If she can just survive Camp Andromeda, and keep her dad from discovering that she&#x2019;s left planet Earth, she&#x2019;s in for the adventure of a lifetime.</p></p><p><b>Mike Lawrence</b> is the award-winning illustrator of <i>Muddy Max: The Mystery of Marsh Creek </i>(with Elizabeth Rusch) and the novel <i>The Incredible Adventures of Cinnamon Girl</i> (by Melissa Keil). The Star Scouts series (published by First Second) is his debut as a solo graphic novelist. In addition to making comics, Mike has created several pieces of public art for his hometown of Portland, Oregon, where he lives with his wife and two sons.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Middle schooler Avani is the new girl in town, so her father signs her up for Flower Scouts to help her make friends. The girls in Flower Scouts talk about boy bands and, well, boys; Avani likes riding bulls and roughing around. Out of nowhere, Avani is abducted by Mabel, a young alien girl who is recruiting kids from other planets to join the Star Scouts, whose members explore the galaxy and the unknown. Avani is an immediate and enthusiastic recruit. She enjoys going on adventures with her new friends, and soon she and the others are taking part in a weeklong trip to Camp Andromeda. But Avani's strong will leads to a conflict with a rival troop, and, suddenly, her membership in Star Scouts is at stake. This is a gorgeous book, with lush imagery that brings to mind Craig Thompson's Space Dumplins. However, the plot is lacking, as the rivalry at Camp Andromeda follows a predictable us vs. them&#x2014;narrative. The characters have heart aplenty, but their frequent use of toilet humor relegates the book to a younger audience. Avani herself is a difficult heroine for whom to root: the story sets up readers to dislike the girls with whom Avani clashes at Camp Andromeda, yet the protagonist delivers as many insults and nasty actions as she receives. VERDICT An additional purchase for libraries looking for a visually appealing selection to fill out their graphic novel sections.&#x2014;Matisse Mozer, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>Islam in Focus</h2><p>This popular book is an attempt to respond to the needs of both Muslims and non-Muslims in North America.

His next novel in the series is forthcoming soon from Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Minotaur.</p>VOICES (Chapter 1) <p>El�nborg was waiting for them at the hotel.</p><p>A large Christmas tree stood in the lobby and there were decorations, fir branches and glittering baubles all around. &#x2018;Silent night, holy night&#x2019;, over an invisible sound system. A large shuttle coach stood in front of the hotel and a group approached the reception desk. Tourists who were planning to spend Christmas and the New Year in Iceland because it seemed to them like an adventurous and exciting country. Although they had only just landed, many had apparently already bought traditional Icelandic sweaters, and they checked into the exotic land of winter. Erlendur brushed the sleet off his raincoat. Sigurdur �li looked around the lobby and caught sight of El�nborg by the lifts. He tugged at Erlendur and they walked over to her. She had examined the scene. The first police officers to arrive there had made sure that it would remain untouched.</p><p>The hotel manager had asked them not to cause a fracas. Used that phrase when he rang. This was a hotel and hotels thrive on their reputations, and he asked them to take that into account. So there were no sirens outside, nor uniformed policemen bursting in through the lobby. The manager said that at all costs they should avoid arousing fear among the guests.</p><p>Iceland mustn&#x2019;t be too exciting, too much of an adventure.</p><p>Now he was standing next to El�nborg and greeted Erlendur and Sigurdur �li with a handshake. He was so fat that his suit hardly encompassed his body. His jacket was done up across the stomach by one button that was on the verge of giving up. The top of his trousers was hidden beneath a huge paunch that bulged out of his jacket and the man sweated so furiously that he could never put away the large white handkerchief with which he mopped his forehead and the back of his neck at regular intervals. The white collar of his shirt was soaked in perspiration. Erlendur shook his clammy hand.</p><p>&#x2018;Thank you,&#x2019; the hotel manager said, puffing like a grampus. In his twenty years of managing the hotel he had never encountered anything like this.</p><p>&#x2018;In the middle of the Christmas rush,&#x2019; he groaned. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t understand how this could happen! How could it happen?&#x2019; he repeated, leaving them in no doubt as to how totally perplexed he was.</p><p>&#x2018;Is he up or down?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Up or down?&#x2019; the fat manager puffed. &#x2018;Do you mean whether he&#x2019;s gone to heaven?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s exactly what we need to know...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Shall we take the lift upstairs?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked.</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; the manager said, casting an irritated look at Erlendur. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s down here in the basement. He&#x2019;s got a little room there. We didn&#x2019;t want to chuck him out. And then you get this for your troubles.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Why would you have wanted to chuck him out?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>The hotel manager looked at him but did not reply.</p><p>They walked slowly down the stairs beside the lift. The manager went first. Going down the stairs was a strain for him and Erlendur wondered how he would get back up.</p><p>Apart from Erlendur, they had agreed to show a certain amount of consideration, to try to approach the hotel as discreetly as possible. Three police cars were parked at the back, with an ambulance. Police officers and paramedics had gone in through the back door. The district medical officer was on his way. He would certify the death and call out a van to transport the body.</p><p>They walked down a long corridor with the panting manager leading the way. Plain-clothes policemen greeted them. The corridor grew darker the further they walked, because the light bulbs on the ceiling had blown and no one had bothered to change them. Eventually, in the darkness, they reached the door, which opened onto a little room. It was more like a storage space than a dwelling, but there was a narrow bed inside, a small desk and a tattered mat on the dirty tiled floor. There was a little window up near the ceiling.</p><p>The man was sitting on the bed, leaning against the wall. He was wearing a bright red Santa suit and still had the Santa cap on his head, but it had slipped down over his eyes. A large artificial Santa beard hid his face. He had undone the thick belt around his waist and unbuttoned his jacket. Beneath it he was wearing only a white vest. There was a fatal wound to his heart. Although there were other wounds on the body, the stabbing through the heart had finished him off. His hands had slash marks on them, as if he had tried to fight off the assailant. His trousers were down round his ankles. A condom hung from his penis.</p><p>&#x2018;Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li warbled, looking down at the body.</p><p>El�nborg hushed him.</p><p>In the room was a small wardrobe and the door was open. It contained folded trousers and sweaters, ironed shirts, underwear and socks. A uniform hung on a coat-hanger, navy blue with golden epaulettes and shiny brass buttons. A pair of smartly-polished black leather shoes stood beside the cupboard.</p><p>Newspapers and magazines were strewn over the floor. Beside the bed was a small table and lamp. On the table was a single book: A History of the Vienna Boys&#x2019; Choir.</p><p>&#x2018;Did he live here, this man?&#x2019; Erlendur asked as he surveyed the scene. He and El�nborg had entered the room. Sigurdur �li and the hotel manager were standing outside. It was too small for them all inside.</p><p>&#x2018;We let him stay here,&#x2019; the manager said awkwardly, mopping the sweat from his brow. &#x2018;He&#x2019;s been working for us for donkey&#x2019;s years. Since before my time. As a doorman.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Was the door open when he was found?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked, trying to be formal, as if to compensate for his little ditty.</p><p>&#x2018;I asked her to wait for you,&#x2019; the manager said. &#x2018;The girl who found him. She&#x2019;s in the staff coffee room. Gave her quite a shock, poor thing, as you can imagine.&#x2019; The manager avoided looking into the room.</p><p>Erlendur walked up to the body and peered at the wound to the heart. He had no idea what kind of blade had killed the man. He looked up. Above the bed was an old, faded poster for a Shirley Temple film, sellotaped at the corners. Erlendur didn&#x2019;t know the film. It was called The Little Princess. The poster was the only decoration in the room.</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked from the doorway as he looked at the poster.</p><p>&#x2018;It says on it,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;Shirley Temple.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s that then? Is she dead?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s Shirley Temple?&#x2019; El�nborg was astonished at Sigurdur �li&#x2019;s ignorance. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you know who she was? Didn&#x2019;t you study in America?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Was she a Hollywood star?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked, still looking at the poster.</p><p>&#x2018;She was a child star,&#x2019; Erlendur said curtly. &#x2018;So she&#x2019;s dead in a sense anyway.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Eh?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, failing to grasp the remark.</p><p>&#x2018;A child star,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;I think she&#x2019;s still alive. I don&#x2019;t remember. I think she&#x2019;s something with the United Nations.&#x2019;</p><p>It dawned on Erlendur that there were no other personal effects in the room. He looked around but could see no bookshelf, CDs or computer, no radio or television. Only a desk, chair, wardrobe and bed with a scruffy pillow and dirty duvet cover. The little room reminded him of a prison cell.</p><p>He went out into the corridor and peered into the darkness at the far end, and could make out a faint smell of burning, as if someone had been playing with matches there or possibly lighting their way.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s down there?&#x2019; he asked the manager.</p><p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he replied and looked up at the ceiling. &#x2018;Just the end of the corridor. A couple of bulbs have gone. I&#x2019;ll have that fixed.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How long had he lived here, this man?&#x2019; Erlendur asked as he went back into the room.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, since before my time.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So he was here when you became the manager?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Are you telling me he lived in this hole for twenty years?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>El�nborg looked at the condom.</p><p>&#x2018;At least he practised safe sex,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>&#x2018;Not safe enough,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>At that point the district medical officer arrived, accompanied by a member of the hotel staff who then went back along the corridor. The medical officer was very fat too, although nowhere near a match for the hotel manager. When he squeezed into the room, El�nborg darted back out for air.</p><p>&#x2018;Hello, Erlendur,&#x2019; the medical officer said.</p><p>&#x2018;What does it look like?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Heart attack, but I need a better look,&#x2019; replied the medical officer, who was known for his appalling sense of humour.</p><p>Erlendur looked out at Sigurdur �li and El�nborg, who were grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>&#x2018;Do you know when it happened?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t be very long ago. Some time during the last two hours. He&#x2019;s hardly begun to go cold. Have you located his reindeer?&#x2019;</p><p>Erlendur groaned.</p><p>The medical officer lifted his hand from the body.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll sign the certificate,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;You send it to the mortuary and they&#x2019;ll open him up there. They say that orgasm is a kind of moment of death,&#x2019; he added, looking down at the body. &#x2018;So he had a double.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A double?&#x2019; Erlendur didn&#x2019;t understand him.</p><p>&#x2018;Orgasm, I mean,&#x2019; the medical officer said. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll take photographs, won&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said.</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ll look nice in his family album.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t appear to have any family,&#x2019; Erlendur said and looked around the room again. &#x2018;So you&#x2019;re done for the time being?&#x2019; he asked, eager to put an end to the wisecracks.</p><p>The district medical officer nodded, squeezed back out of the room and went down the corridor.</p><p>&#x2018;Won&#x2019;t we have to close down the hotel?&#x2019; El�nborg asked, and noticed the manager gasp at her question. &#x2018;Stop all traffic in and out. Question everyone staying here and all the staff? Close the airports. Stop ships leaving port...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;For God&#x2019;s sake,&#x2019; the manager groaned, squeezing his handkerchief with an imploring look at Erlendur. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s only the doorman!&#x2019;</p><p>Mary and Joseph would never have been given a room here, Erlendur thought to himself.</p><p>&#x2018;This...this...filth has nothing to do with my guests,&#x2019; the manager spluttered with indignation. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re tourists, almost all of them, and regional people, businessmen and the like. No one who has anything to do with the doorman. No one. This is one of the largest hotels in Reykjav�k. It&#x2019;s packed over the holidays. You can&#x2019;t just close it down! You just can&#x2019;t!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We could, but we won&#x2019;t,&#x2019; Erlendur said, trying to calm the manager down. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll need to question some of the guests and most of the staff, I expect.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Thank God,&#x2019; the manager sighed, regaining his composure.</p><p>&#x2018;What was the man&#x2019;s name?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Gudlaugur,&#x2019; the manager said. &#x2018;I think he&#x2019;s around fifty. And you&#x2019;re right about his family, I don&#x2019;t think he has any.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who visited him?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t got a clue,&#x2019; the manager puffed.</p><p>&#x2018;Has anything unusual happened at the hotel involving this man?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Theft?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No. Nothing&#x2019;s happened.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Complaints?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He hasn&#x2019;t become embroiled in anything that could explain this?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not as far as I know.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Was he involved in any conflicts with anyone at this hotel?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not that I know of.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Outside the hotel?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not that I know of but I don&#x2019;t know him very well. Didn&#x2019;t,&#x2019; the manager corrected himself.</p><p>&#x2018;Not after twenty years?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, not really. He wasn&#x2019;t very sociable, I don&#x2019;t think. Kept himself to himself as much as he could.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you think a hotel is the right place for a man like him?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Me? I don&#x2019;t know...He was always very polite and there were never really any complaints about him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Never really?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, there were never any complaints about him. He wasn&#x2019;t a bad worker really.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Where&#x2019;s the staff coffee room?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x2019; The hotel manager mopped his brow, relieved that they would not close the hotel.</p><p>&#x2018;Did he have guests?&#x2019; Erlendur asked.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; the manager said.</p><p>&#x2018;Guests,&#x2019; Erlendur repeated. &#x2018;It looks like someone who knew him was here, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x2019;</p><p>The manager looked at the body and his eyes dwelled on the condom.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know anything about his girlfriends,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Nothing at all.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t know very much about this man,&#x2019; Erlendur said.</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s a doorman here,&#x2019; the manager said, and felt that Erlendur should accept that by way of explanation.</p><p>They left the room. The forensics team went in with their equipment and more officers followed them. It was difficult for them all to squeeze their way past the manager. Erlendur asked them to examine the corridor carefully and the dark alcove further down. Sigurdur �li and El�nborg stood inside the little room observing the body.</p><p>&#x2018;I wouldn&#x2019;t like to be found like that,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s no concern of his any more,&#x2019; El�nborg said.</p><p>&#x2018;No, probably not,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>&#x2018;Is there anything in it?&#x2019; El�nborg asked as she took out a little bag of salted peanuts. She was always nibbling at things. Sigurdur �li thought it was because of nerves.</p><p>&#x2018;In it?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>She nodded in the direction of the body. After staring at her for a moment, Sigurdur �li realised what she meant. He hesitated, then knelt down by the body and stared at the condom.</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s empty.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So she killed him before his orgasm,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;The doctor thought&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, isn&#x2019;t that obvious?&#x2019; El�nborg said, emptying a handful of peanuts into her mouth. She offered some to Sigurdur �li, who declined. &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t there something tarty about it? He&#x2019;s had a woman in here,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Hasn&#x2019;t he?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s the simplest theory,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, standing up.</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t think so?&#x2019; El�nborg said.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t have the faintest idea.&#x2019;</p><p>VOICES Copyright � 2003 by Arnaldur Indridason</p></p><h2>Bringing the Sacred to Life: The Daily Practice of Zen Ritual (Dharma Communications)</h2><p>Zen rituals&#x2014;such as chanting, bowing, lighting incense before the Buddha statue&#x2014;are ways of recognizing the sacredness in all of life. A ritual is simply a deliberate and focused moment that symbolizes the care with which we should be approaching all of life, and practicing the Zen liturgy is a way of cultivating this quality of attention in order to bring it to everything we do. Here, John Daido Loori demystifies the details of the Zen rituals and highlights their deeper meaning and purpose. We humans are all creatures of ritual, he teaches, whether we recognize it or not. Even if we don&#x2019;t make ritual part of some religious observance, we still fall into ritual behavior, whether it be our daily grooming sequence or the way we have our morning coffee and paper. We run through our personal rituals unconsciously most of the time, but there is great value to introducing meaningful symbolic rituals into our lives and to performing them deliberately and mindfully&#x2014;because the way we do ritual affects the way we live the rest of our lives. The book includes instructions for a simple Zen home liturgy, as it is practiced by students of the Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen.</p><p>John Daido Loori (1931&#x2013;2009) was one of the West's leading Zen masters. He was the founder and spiritual leader of the Mountains and Rivers Order and abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery. His work has been most noted for its unique adaptation of traditional Asian Buddhism into an American context, particularly with regard to the arts, the environment, social action, and the use of modern media as a vehicle of spiritual training and social change. Loori was an award-winning photographer and videographer. His art and wildlife photography formed the core of a unique teaching program that integrated art and wilderness training by cultivating a deep appreciation of the relationship of Zen to our natural environment. He was a dharma heir of the influential Japanese Zen master Taizan Maezumi Roshi and he authored many books.</p><h2>Everyday Meditations</h2><p>Over the years, the brilliant and often voluminous scholarly writings of Bl.

John Henry Newman (1801-1890), have drawn into the Church thousands more converts after him. <p> In this more modest work, his Everyday Meditations, we encounter not Newman the intellectual but Newman the simple Christian, on his knees face-to-face with God. Confident that the Church teaches us rightly but knowing as well that each of us must walk closely with God hearing His voice not only through the Church but in the depths of our own hearts. </p><p> This was Newman's greatest desire. It awakened in him ceaseless prayer, countless good works, a profound love of the sacraments, and the habit of daily meditation which strengthened his will, deepened his understanding, and enkindled in him an ever greater love of God. For those qualities, Pope Benedict XVI recently proclaimed Newman "Blessed," just one step from declaring him a saint. </p><p> The Catechism of the Catholic Church says that ongoing growth in sanctity is "an uninterrupted task for the whole Church." If in recent times yours has been interrupted (or merely slowed down), let it begin anew with this modest book. </p><p> To help you discern God's voice daily, rest in it, and respond to it according to each day's opportunities and needs, we have here gathered fifty of Newman's most moving Christian meditations, each guaranteed to enkindle in your soul the very same kind of love they enkindled in his. As they nurtured Newman's daily acts of conversion and finally made him worthy of the title "Blessed," so will they call you to daily acts of conversion and finally lead you, as they led Newman, "to bow down in awe before the depths of God's love."</p>Blessed John Henry Newman was an Anglican clergyman and teacher at Oxford University who eventually became a Catholic in 1845. Soon afterwards he was ordained a Catholic priest and started the English Oratory of St. Philip Neri. Newman, a prolific writer of English prose, was an educator and the founder of the Catholic University of Ireland. Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal in 1879. Pope Benedict XVI beatified him in Birmingham, England on September 19, 2010.</p><h2>Cooking with Cafe Pasqual&#39;s: Recipes from Santa Fe&#39;s Renowned Corner Cafe [A Cookbook]</h2><p>For more than 25 years, Caf?� Pasqual's has kept loyal fans coming back with this simple philosophy: serve wonderful, fresh food with friendly service in a festive atmosphere.

The Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, although I have no idea what the function of either actually is. Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and a lot of kings named Louis. I&#x2019;m not sure what they did either, but I think it has something to do with the French Revolution, which has something to do with Bastille Day. The art museum is called the Louvre and it&#x2019;s shaped like a pyramid and the <i>Mona Lisa</i> lives there along with that statue of the woman missing her arms. And there are caf�s or bistros or whatever they call them on every street corner. And mimes. The food is supposed to be good, and the people drink a lot of wine and smoke a lot of cigarettes.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard they don&#x2019;t like Americans, and they don&#x2019;t like white sneakers.</p><p>A few months ago, my father enrolled me in boarding school.

And I would&#x2019;ve pointed out his misuse of the word had I not already been freaking out.</p><p>Since his announcement, I&#x2019;ve tried yelling, begging, pleading, and crying, but nothing has convinced him otherwise. And now I have a new student visa and a passport, each declaring me: Anna Oliphant, citizen of the United States of America. And now I&#x2019;m here with my parents&#x2014;unpacking my belongings in a room smaller than my suitcase&#x2014;the newest senior at the School of America in Paris.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m ungrateful. I mean, it&#x2019;s <i>Paris</i>. The City of Light! The most romantic city in the world! I&#x2019;m not immune to that. It&#x2019;s just this whole international boarding school thing is a lot more about my father than it is about me. Ever since he sold out and started writing lame books that were turned into even lamer movies, he&#x2019;s been trying to impress his big-shot New York friends with how cultured and rich he is.</p><p>My father isn&#x2019;t cultured. But he is rich.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t always like this.When my parents were still married, we were strictly lower middle class. It was around the time of the divorce that all traces of decency vanished, and his dream of being the next great Southern writer was replaced by his desire to be the next <i>published</i> writer. So he started writing these novels set in Small Town Georgia about folks with Good American Values who Fall in Love and then contract Life-Threatening Diseases and Die.</p><p>I&#x2019;m serious.</p><p>And it totally depresses me, but the ladies eat it up.They love my father&#x2019;s books and they love his cable-knit sweaters and they love his bleachy smile and orangey tan. And they have turned him into a bestseller and a total dick.</p><p>Two of his books have been made into movies and three more are in production, which is where his real money comes from. Hollywood. And, somehow, this extra cash and pseudo-prestige have warped his brain into thinking that I should live in France. For a year. Alone. I don&#x2019;t understand why he couldn&#x2019;t send me to Australia or Ireland or anywhere else where English is the native language. The only French word I know is <i>oui</i>, which means &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; and only recently did I learn it&#x2019;s spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e.</p><p>At least the people in my new school speak English. It was founded for pretentious Americans who don&#x2019;t like the company of their own children. I mean, really. Who sends their kid to boarding school? It&#x2019;s so Hogwarts. Only mine doesn&#x2019;t have cute boy wizards or magic candy or flying lessons.</p><p>Instead, I&#x2019;m stuck with ninety-nine other students. There are twenty-five people in my <i>entire senior class,</i> as opposed to the six hundred I had back in Atlanta. And I&#x2019;m studying the same things I studied at Clairemont High except now I&#x2019;m registered in beginning French.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Beginning French. No doubt with the freshmen. I totally rock.</p><p>Mom says I need to lose the bitter factor, pronto, but she&#x2019;s not the one leaving behind her fabulous best friend, Bridgette. Or her fabulous job at the Royal Midtown 14 multiplex. Or Toph, the fabulous boy at the Royal Midtown 14 multiplex.</p><p>And I still can&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;s separating me from my brother, Sean, who is only seven and way too young to be left home alone after school. Without me, he&#x2019;ll probably be kidnapped by that creepy guy down the road who has dirty Coca-Cola towels hanging in his windows. Or Seany will accidentally eat something containing Red Dye #40 and his throat will swell up and no one will be there to drive him to the hospital. He might even die. And I bet they wouldn&#x2019;t let me fly home for his funeral and I&#x2019;d have to visit the cemetery alone next year and Dad will have picked out some god-awful granite cherub to go over his grave.</p><p>And I hope Dad doesn&#x2019;t expect me to fill out college applications to Russia or Romania now. My dream is to study film theory in California. I want to be our nation&#x2019;s greatest female film critic. Someday I&#x2019;ll be invited to every festival, and I&#x2019;ll have a major newspaper column and a cool television show and a ridiculously popular website. So far I only have the website, and it&#x2019;s not so popular.Yet.</p><p>I just need a little more time to work on it, that&#x2019;s all.</p><p>&#x201c;Anna, it&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I glance up from folding my shirts into perfect squares.</p><p>Mom stares at me and twiddles the turtle charm on her necklace. My father, bedecked in a peach polo shirt and white boating shoes, is gazing out my dormitory window. It&#x2019;s late, but across the street a woman belts out something operatic.</p><p>My parents need to return to their hotel rooms. They both have early morning flights.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I grip the shirt in my hands a little tighter.</p><p>Dad steps away from the window, and I&#x2019;m alarmed to discover his eyes are wet. Something about the idea of my father&#x2014;even if it is <i>my father</i>&#x2014;on the brink of tears raises a lump in my throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, kiddo. Guess you&#x2019;re all grown up now.&#x201d;</p><p>My body is frozen. He pulls my stiff limbs into a bear hug. His grip is frightening. &#x201c;Take care of yourself. Study hard and make some friends. And watch out for pickpockets,&#x201d; he adds. &#x201c;Sometimes they work in pairs.&#x201d;</p><p>I nod into his shoulder, and he releases me. And then he&#x2019;s gone.</p><p>My mother lingers behind. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have a wonderful year here,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I just know it.&#x201d; I bite my lip to keep it from quivering, and she sweeps me into her arms. I try to breathe. Inhale. Count to three. Exhale. Her skin smells like grapefruit body lotion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you the moment I get home,&#x201d; she says.</p><p><i>Home</i>. Atlanta isn&#x2019;t my home anymore.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you, Anna.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m crying now. &#x201c;I love you, too. Take care of Seany for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Captain Jack,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Make sure Sean feeds him and changes his bedding and fills his water bottle. And make sure he doesn&#x2019;t give him too many treats because they make him fat and then he can&#x2019;t get out of his igloo. But make sure he gives him at least a few every day, because he still needs the vitamin C and he won&#x2019;t drink the water when I use those vitamin drops&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She pulls back and tucks my bleached stripe behind my ear. &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; she says again.</p><p>And then my mother does something that, even after all of the paperwork and plane tickets and presentations, I don&#x2019;t see coming. Something that would&#x2019;ve happened in a year anyway, once I left for college, but that no matter how many days or months or years I&#x2019;ve yearned for it, I am still not prepared for when it actually happens.</p><p>My mother leaves. I am alone.</p><p>chapter two</p><p>I feel it coming, but I can&#x2019;t stop it.</p><p>PANIC.</p><p>They left me. My parents actually left me! IN FRANCE!</p><p>Meanwhile, Paris is oddly silent. Even the opera singer has packed it in for the night. I <i>cannot</i> lose it. The walls here are thinner than Band-Aids, so if I break down, my neighbors&#x2014;my new classmates&#x2014;will hear everything. I&#x2019;m going to be sick. I&#x2019;m going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade I had for dinner, and everyone will hear, and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever it is people do here in their spare time.</p><p>I race to my pedestal sink to splash water on my face, but it explodes out and sprays my shirt instead. And now I&#x2019;m crying harder, because I haven&#x2019;t unpacked my towels, and wet clothing reminds me of those stupid water rides Bridgette and Matt used to drag me on at Six Flags where the water is the wrong color and it smells like paint and it has a billion trillion bacterial microbes in it. Oh God.What if there are bacterial microbes in the water? Is French water even safe to drink?</p><p>Pathetic. I&#x2019;m pathetic.</p><p>How many seventeen-year-olds would kill to leave home? My neighbors aren&#x2019;t experiencing any meltdowns. No crying coming from behind <i>their</i> bedroom walls. I grab a shirt off the bed to blot myself dry, when the solution strikes. <i>My pillow.</i> I collapse face-first into the sound barrier and sob and sob and sob.</p><p>Someone is knocking on my door.</p><p>No. Surely that&#x2019;s not my door.</p><p>There it is again!</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; a girl calls from the hallway. &#x201c;Hello? Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>No, I&#x2019;m not okay. GO AWAY. But she calls again, and I&#x2019;m obligated to crawl off my bed and answer the door. A blonde with long, tight curls waits on the other side. She&#x2019;s tall and big, but not overweight-big.Volleyball player big. A diamondlike nose ring sparkles in the hall light. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; Her voice is gentle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Meredith; I live next door. Were those your parents who just left?&#x201d;</p><p>My puffy eyes signal the affirmative.</p><p>&#x201c;I cried the first night, too.&#x201d; She tilts her head, thinks for a moment, and then nods. &#x201c;Come on. <i>Chocolat chaud.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A chocolate show?&#x201d; Why would I want to see a chocolate show? My mother has abandoned me and I&#x2019;m terrified to leave my room and&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She smiles. &#x201c;<i>Chaud</i>. Hot. Hot chocolate, I can make some in my room.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Despite myself, I follow. Meredith stops me with her hand like a crossing guard. She&#x2019;s wearing rings on all five fingers. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget your key. The doors automatically lock behind you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; And I tug the necklace out from underneath my shirt to prove it. I slipped my key onto it during this weekend&#x2019;s required Life Skills Seminars for new students, when they told us how easy it is to get locked out.</p><p>We enter her room. I gasp. It&#x2019;s the same impossible size as mine, seven by ten feet, with the same mini-desk, mini-dresser, mini-bed, mini-fridge, mini-sink, and mini-shower. (No mini-toilet, those are shared down the hall.) But . . . unlike my own sterile cage, every inch of wall and ceiling is covered with posters and pictures and shiny wrapping paper and brightly colored flyers written in French.</p><p>&#x201c;How long have you <i>been</i> here?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>Meredith hands me a tissue and I blow my nose, a terrible honk like an angry goose, but she doesn&#x2019;t flinch or make a face. &#x201c;I arrived yesterday. This is my fourth year here, so I didn&#x2019;t have to go to the seminars. I flew in alone, so I&#x2019;ve just been hanging out, waiting for my friends to show up.&#x201d; She looks around with her hands on her hips, admiring her handiwork. I spot a pile of magazines, scissors, and tape on her floor and realize it&#x2019;s a work in progress. &#x201c;Not bad, eh? White walls don&#x2019;t do it for me.&#x201d;</p><p>I circle her room, examining everything. I quickly discover that most of the faces are the same five people: John, Paul, George, Ringo, and some soccer guy I don&#x2019;t recognize.</p><p>&#x201c;The Beatles are all I listen to. My friends tease me, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; I point to Soccer Guy. He&#x2019;s wearing red and white, and he&#x2019;s all dark eyebrows and dark hair. Quite good-loo...</p></p><h2>Why Good People Do Bad Things: Understanding Our Darker Selves</h2><p><b>Working with the Shadow is not working with evil, per se. It is working toward the possibility of greater wholeness. We will never experience healing until we can come to love our unlovable places, for they, too, ask love of us.&nbsp;</b><br><br>How is it that good people do bad things? Why is our personal story and our societal history so bloody, so repetitive, so injurious to self and others?&nbsp;<br><br>How do we make sense of the discrepancies between who we think we are&#x2014;or who we show to the outside world&#x2014;versus our everyday behaviors? Why are otherwise ordinary people driven to addictions and compulsions, whether alcohol, drugs, food, shopping, infidelity, or the Internet? Why are interpersonal relationships so often filled with strife?<p>Exploring Jung&#x2019;s concept of the Shadow&#x2014;the unconscious parts of our self that contradict the image of the self we hope to project--<i>Why Good People Do Bad Things&nbsp;</i>guides you through all the ways in which many of our seemingly unexplainable behaviors are manifestations of the Shadow. In addition to its presence in our personal lives, Hollis looks at the larger picture of the Shadow at work in our culture&#x2014;from organized religion to the suffering and injustice that abounds in our modern world. Accepting and examining the Shadow as part of one&#x2019;s self, Hollis suggests, is the first step toward wholeness. Revealing a new way of understanding our darker selves, Hollis offers wisdom to help you to acquire a more conscious conduct of your life and bring a new level of awareness to your daily actions and choices.</p></p><p>James Hollis, Ph.D., is a Jungian analyst in private practice and executive director of the C.G.

Turning Points historical graphic novels bring these moments in American history to life. <br> <br> Sixteen-year-old William McNally and fifteen-year-old Thomas Johnson both live in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the summer of 1957. They both love baseball and teasing their little sisters. There's just one big difference -- William is white, and Thomas, the son of William's family's maid, is black. After the Supreme Court rules in favor of desegregating public schools, Little Rock Central High School prepares to enroll its first nine African-American students, and William and Thomas are caught in the center of a storm.</p><p>MARSHALL POE is a professor, writer, and consultant. After earning his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, he taught for a decade at Harvard University. He was then a writer and editor at &#34;The Atlantic Monthly,&#34; where he focused on the Internet. He is currently an associate professor of history at the University of Iowa.Grade 4 Up&#x2014;In 1957, Little Rock faces a split populace as it attempts to integrate a high school after the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ruling. This book focuses on two fictional teens: Will McNally, the white son of a local attorney, and Thomas Johnson, the black son of his domestic help. Their tenuous friendship is the lens for the conflict as each teen wrestles with the larger social implications of the Supreme Court decision. While the artwork is flat and the faces overly simplified so as to mute expression, details of fashion and decor help to emphasize the setting. Most evocative is the frequent depiction of African Americans silently doing menial jobs while the discussion of their roles and rights happens around them. A variety of perspectives and concerns are expressed, and only Will's grandfather comes across as a straw man for racism. The debates have an easy, conversational flow, and what could be a staid reenactment of a civics lesson takes on the character of an actual event. There is a difficult balance required while creating composite characters to work alongside actual participants and not supplant their historical roles. The book ends up more about the issues than the event that inspired them.&#x2014;<i>Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gensler, S.J., is Professor of Philosophy at Loyola University Chicago. His fourteen earlier books include <i>G�del&#x2019;s Theorem Simplified </i>(1984), <i>Formal Ethics </i>(1996), <i>Catholic Philosophy Anthology </i>(2005), <i>Historical Dictionary of Logic </i>(2006), <i>Historical Dictionary of Ethics </i>(2008), <i>Ethics: A Contemporary Introduction </i>(1998 &amp; 2011), <i>Ethics and the Golden Rule </i>(2013), and <i>Ethics and Religion </i>(2016).</p><p>"Gensler&#x2019;s book would shine as the primary text in an advanced logic course, as a common text in a scaffolded sequence of courses, or as a supplemental text in a course that focuses on the philosophical issues raised within and by formal logic. His writing style is engaging, and his explanations of difficult philosophical concepts are exceptionally accessible and clear. He is, in fact, a joy to read in this respect."</p> <p><strong>&#x2013;Dona Warren in <i>Teaching Philosophy</i></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Equal parts eloquent and instructive, Gensler has once again provided an invaluable resource for those looking to master the fundamental principles of logic. The Third Edition improves upon an already exceptional text by infusing the introduction of new concepts with enhanced clarity, rendering even the most challenging material a joy to teach.

I have used Gensler&#x2019;s book to teach introductory courses in logic to undergraduate philosophers and linguists, and the response from the students has always been positive. They appreciate its clear explanation and the wealth of examples and practice opportunities it provides. In particular, the translation exercises help to refine logico-semantic intuitions. The supporting LogiCola software, which is feely downloadable, is a great support tool." </p> <p><strong>--Mark Jary,<em> University of Roehampton, UK</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"The Third Edition is an improved version of an already excellent introduction to logic. Gensler&#x2019;s Reductio proof procedure enables a seamless transition from elementary propositional logic to quantification theory and more advanced modal logics. Many of the exercises involve formulations of philosophical problems. The explanations of advanced topics have been greatly improved. The upgraded LogiCola program now supports alternative proof procedures.

Souls who have reached such perfection in this life are rare; not so rare, however, are those who ardently aspire thereto. It is chiefly for such as these - to encourage and help them to arrive at those same heights - that these thoughts have been preserved and collected. They Speak by Silences was first published in French in 1948, and has since allowed Carthusian wisdom and spirituality to reach the widest possible audience. This new, and widely requested edition carries on the tradition. It will provide material for daily reading and reflection for newcomers to Carthusian spirituality and, equally, for those who have already discovered the riches it has to offer. Not everyone can experience that same recollection that exists in a Charterhouse, but they must not be afraid to set aside as far as possible at least some moments, however short, for recollection and to give some time to Him Who is within them. It is in that silence that He speaks to us, and bids us listen to Him. Other books of classic Carthusian spirituality published by Gracewing include The Call of Silent Love, The Prayer of Love and Silence and The Wound of Love.</p><p></p><h2>America&#39;s Story 2 (Student)</h2><p><p>America had formed its fledgling nation, but all was not well within the Union. Slavery continued to cause disputes among the states until there was a civil war. Conflicts emerged as settlements kept expanding to the West, encroaching on Native American lands. And the Industrial Revolution was changing the way Americans lived and worked in the growing nation. In the lives of soldiers and sailors, outlaws and lawmen, pastors and pioneers, as well as Native Americans struggling to continue their traditional way of life, we see the history and controversies of the resilient nation unfold before us.</p> <p><em>Volume Two</em> in this series for your elementary students includes:</p> <ul> <li>Interesting photographs, maps, and illustrations to help students visualize and relate to historical events</li> <li>Cultural connections between the events of the past and the modern world we see today</li> <li>Important features and narratives that add to the student's understanding of history from different perspectives</li> </ul> <p>Join us as we explore "one nation under God" as America stretches across the continent and tests the limits of the Constitution that binds it together. Discover why this nation then and now draws those seeking freedom to its shores from around the world as each person helps build the nation toward a prosperous future and contributes their story to American history.</p></p><p><p>As a homeschooling mom and author, ANGELA O'DELL embraces many aspects of the Charlotte Mason method, yet knows that modern children need an education that fits the needs of this generation.

Particularly renowned for the memorable women she created for such works as <i>My �ntonia</i> and <i>O Pioneers!</i>, she pens the portrait of another formidable character in <i>The Song of the Lark</i>. This, her third novel, traces the struggle of the woman as artist in an era when a women's role was far more rigidly defined than it is today.<br>The prototype for the main character as a child and adolescent was Cather herself, while a leading Wagnerian soprano at the Metropolitan Opera (Olive Fremstad) became the model for Thea Kronborg, the singer who defies the limitations placed on women of her time and social station to become an international opera star. A coming-of-age novel, important for the issues of gender and class that it explores, <i>The Song of the Lark</i> is one of Cather's most popular and lyrical works.</p></p><p>"The time will come when she will be ranked above Hemingway." --Leon Edel <p>In this powerful portrait of the self-making of an artist, Willa Cather created one of her most extraordinary heroines. Thea Kronborg, a minister's daughter in a provincial Colorado town, seems destined from childhood for a place in the wider world. But as her path to the world stage leads her ever farther from the humble town she can't forget and from the man she can't afford to love, Thea learns that her exceptional musical talent and fierce ambition are not enough. <br>It is in the solitude of a tiny rock chamber high in the side of an Arizona cliff--"a cleft in the heart of the world"--that Thea comes face to face with her own dreams and desires, stripped clean by the haunting purity of the ruined cliff dwellings and inspired by the whisperings of their ancient dust. Here she finds the courage to seize her future and to use her gifts to catch "the shining, elusive element that is life itself--life hurrying past us and running away, too strong to stop, too sweet to lose." In prose as shimmering and piercingly true as the light in a desert canyon, Cather takes us into the heart of a woman coming to know her deepest self.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Willa Cather (1873&#x2013;1947) spent her formative years in Nebraska, which was at that time frontier territory. Her exposure to the region's dramatic environment and intrinsic hardships &#x2014; along with its diverse population of European-Americans, Native Americans, and immigrants &#x2014; shaped and informed much of her fiction.</p></p><h2>Modulation (Dover Books On Music: Analysis)</h2><p>"I consider him a genius," remarked Arnold Schoenberg of the progressive early modernist Max Reger (1873&#x2013;1916). In addition to his international renown as a teacher, conductor, and pianist, Reger wrote more than 1,000 works in virtually every musical genre. Many scholars and musicians credit him with emancipating dissonance to a level that assisted Schoenberg's development of serialism in the 1920s. Reger's influence extends to other 20th-century composers, including B�la B�rtok, Alban Berg, Arthur Honegger, Paul Hindemith, and Sergei Prokofiev.<br>Modulation &#x2014; the change from one key to another &#x2014; is a subject of critical importance to performers and composers in their study of harmony. Reger wrote this concise guide to modulation while teaching composition at Leipzig Conservatory, and the work continues to provide valuable insights and instruction for musicians at all levels. This new edition features newly engraved musical examples.</p><p></p><h2>Micawber</h2><p><b>Author of the <i>New York Times</i> Bestsellers <br> <i>The Remarkable Farkle McBride</i> <br> and <br> <i>Marsupial Sue</i></b></p><p><b>John Lithgow</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>I Got Two Dogs</i>;<i> Mahalia Mouse Goes to College</i>;<i> Marsupial Sue Presents: The Runaway Pancake</i>;<i> I&#x2019;m A Manatee</i>;<i> Micawber</i>; <i>Marsupial Sue</i>; <i>The Remarkable Farkle McBride</i>; and <i>Carnival of the Animals</i>.

Visit him online at CFPayne.com.The team behind The Remarkable Farkle McBride returns with another high-spirited tale celebrating the arts. While young Farkle found joy in orchestral music, Micawber the squirrel is a lover of the fine art of painting. The refined New York City rodent makes a weekly scamper from his Central Park nest to the nearby "palace on Fifth Avenue" (the Metropolitan Museum of Art), where he can "feast... his eyes and his heart" on countless masterworks. On one such museum visit Micawber stows away among an art student's supplies and winds up in the woman's apartment, where he clandestinely uses her equipment to paint his own canvases, substituting his bushy tail for a brush. As months pass, the benign bandit assembles his own colorful gallery in his home atop the park's carousel. In a tighter, more linear text than Farkle, Lithgow conveys the sense of discovery and emotional enjoyment one can experience while observing or creating art. The vast majority of lines here have a musical rhythm, though young readers may need to puzzle out the meaning of words like "peregrination." Payne's mixed-media compositions capture an area of Manhattan at its clean, sunny best. His varying perspectives and occasionally paint-splattered backgrounds embrace all the exhilaration of Lithgow's words. Ages 5-8.

Democratic principles and national constitutions assure us of a voice in determining the policies and powers that rule us. What most of us don't realize, however, is that these rules have changed profoundly. These changes endanger us in a multitude of ways, but no one gave us a chance to vote on the political transformation.<br>We have already entered the era of the <i>shadow government, </i>a term I will use in this book to refer to powerful agencies that collect data on every one of us. The shadow government observes our private lives and monitors our finances. It tracks your movements and mine. It listens in on our communications, records our purchases, and archives our decisions and preferences in permanent computer files.<br>The natural reaction to hearing this is to say, "They have no right to do that!" In a truly democratic society, the power lies with the people and not with the government. But in this era of the shadow government, we have lost most of our personal rights. And the loss of our privacy is one of the most evident and most ominous outcomes.<br>You have no say in determining what they learn about you and how they use the information. Because this unelected authority operates in the shadows, it is not subject to meaningful oversight by any democratic institution or recognized arm of government. Intelligence agencies, legislative bodies, the courts, regulatory agencies&#x2014;no center of elected, democratic political power has any real authority over the shadow government.<br>We are living in a dangerous time, when governments throughout the world have allowed an unprecedented network of shadow governments to grow and consolidate power. Those who are starting to control our lives from the shadows conduct massive surveillance and exert extensive military power in countries around the world. While these activities are largely invisible to ordinary citizens, elected governments are aware of the shift in power.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE UPHEAVAL FOLLOWING 9/11<br>&nbsp;<br>When radical Muslims hijacked four commercial airliners on September 11, 2001, and commandeered them on suicide missions to attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we all realized the world had changed in a way that was hard to accept. What we didn't see coming was the way this attack on American soil would introduce a profound shift in power in Western nations. In response to the now-visible threat of Islamist movements against democratic countries, governments took drastic action, making unprecedented changes in national security measures. This went far beyond tighter security at airports and military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. Ostensibly to protect the free citizens of their nations, governments intensified their surveillance of <i>all </i>of us. A troubling feature of modern society is that the security measures taken by governments have become increasingly secretive. Governments can spy on anyone<br>&nbsp;without due cause or due process. They no longer have to obtain judicial approval, undergo legislative review, or be held accountable to any elected body, such as a senate or parliamentary subcommittee. The real political power is now hidden so that no one but insiders and intelligence agencies knows who wields power at the top levels of national governments. Increasingly, anonymous military, intelligence, and security officials have taken control of Western societies in the name of national security.<br>If you wonder how this could happen, consider two things. First, there is the constant threat of attack from rogue nations, radical Muslim terrorists, and antidemocratic forces in possession of weapons of mass destruction. And second, there are the rapid and extensive advancements in invasive technology, a critical tool in the hands of those who make the calls for the shadow government. These two developments have converged to shift the power away from elected governments and into the hands of hidden decision makers. <br>All of this has prophetic significance, which we will explore in a later chapter. It is no accident that the necessary technology exists to enable a world dictator, for the first time in history, to control the earth's population. As intellectual and political elites take over the levers of power, consolidating their control over scientific, economic, and military technologies, the shadow government can secretly manipulate the entire world. And not just the world as a whole, but the lives of individual citizens. No one is protected from their invasive surveillance.<br>The religious intellectual Pierre Teilhard de Chardin pointed out the overwhelming power that would be wielded by a group of brilliant thinkers dedicated to the cause of unrivaled world government. He wrote, "Nothing in the universe can resist the cumulative ardor of a sufficiently large number of enlightened minds working together in organized groups."<br>Almost a century ago, John Buchan, an important figure in post&#x2013;World War I British politics, wrote an intriguing novel titled <i>The Power-House. </i>In it he explored a fictional group of extremely wealthy and powerful individuals who moved behind the scenes of politics, international finance, and business to subvert the national sovereignty of Western governments. The goal of this group was to create and control a system of global government. A self-appointed group of wealthy individuals allied with Western politicians and former key political leaders would hold the <i>real </i>power over democratic nations.<br>&nbsp;<br>HOW THE RULERS WENT INTO HIDING<br>&nbsp;<br>Until the last century, political power was concentrated in very public and widely venerated leaders such as kings, governors, and even dictators who were not shy about making known their power to rule their nations. Some went out of their way to remind citizens exactly who was in control, such as the public displays and massive monuments used by Adolf Hitler in Germany and Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union.<br>However, in the last half of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, a new political power paradigm came into being. In place of highly visible leaders, we now have elected representatives who exert only limited control, while the real power resides with a separate group. The most powerful individuals who control our nations and our lives do their work behind the scenes. They are joined by current and retired political leaders who, along with certain wealthy and influential figures, form an open conspiracy to produce a new global government. Their goal is to replace all existing independent democratic governments.<br>This is the sort of thing we tend to associate with nations that do not have a long history of democracy. However, the hidden leaders of shadow governments operate in both totalitarian and democratic governments throughout the world. Since the end of World War II, the secret global elites have been bolstered by political, financial, military, and governmental leaders from North America and Western Europe.<br>Just as our generation was transformed by the attacks of 9/11, the world was changed almost a century earlier by the terrible devastation of World War I. For the first time, Western nations saw that a massive war could annihilate humanity. The First World War introduced chemical weapons, poison gas, machine guns, and artillery that killed more than forty million soldiers and civilians. (I include in these figures casualties of the 1918&#x2013;22 Russian civil war.) Many of the leaders of Western nations concluded that the most pressing global need was to eliminate the possibility of a future genocidal world war. That concern gave birth to the formulation of a New World Order, which in theory would eliminate the possibility of a future world war. The stated goal of this globalist agenda was to protect humanity from the devastating technology of war. To protect us from another world war, they reasoned, it would be necessary to eliminate every one of the sovereign, independent nations that could wage war against any other state.<br>In the protracted negotiations of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, a number of key Western leaders came to believe that the only way to preserve humanity was to form a partnership involving the real, secret leadership of numerous Western nations. In the name of protecting the world's population from future war, this secret group subverted the historic system of sovereign governments.<br>Initially, they created the League of Nations, which proved to be ineffective. Despite good intentions, the League of Nations failed to prevent the outbreak of a second world war. German, Italian, and Japanese aggression bathed the world in the blood of more than sixty million dead before the Allied victory in 1945. During and following World War II, those who had hoped but failed to create a global government renewed their efforts. In light of possible unrestricted nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States (and later, China), they formulated a new international body that came to be known as the United Nations (UN). What wasn't announced publicly is that the UN was the global elitists' next step in launching in embryonic form the coming world government. Members of the Council on Foreign Relations (created after WWI and still a powerful influence toward global government) virtually wrote the UN charter. This group was dedicated to the proposition that the sovereign states of the West must be secretly joined in a global compact that would make future war impossible. While the goal of world peace was laudable, the unfortunate result was that the foundation for a global government was laid without the knowledge of or approval from the citizens of the Western nations that were affected.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE COMING EVIL<br>&nbsp;<br>It will be difficult for many readers to accept my argument that widely respected political and business leaders would support plans to eliminate the United States and its Constitution in favor of the tyranny of a secret global elite. However, as we will see in later chapters, a series of international crises changed the thinking of these leaders, spurring the consolidation of power in the shadow government. Two world wars, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and the constant threat of attack from radical Muslim forces fuel the move toward globalism. And what we have seen so far is only a hint of what is to come.<br>We are rapidly approaching the greatest crisis in history. Jesus Christ warned that humanity would experience an unprecedented crisis just before He returned to establish His eternal Kingdom on earth. Jesus prophesied a "great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be" (Matthew 24:21). The prophet Daniel foretold that the terrible time of tribulation will last seven years and will conclude with the battle of Armageddon and the Messiah's triumphant return to earth (see Daniel 9:24&#x2013;27). The biblical prophets also warned that the most evil man in history would arise during the final generation of this age. This man will be empowered by Satan to seize political, economic, military, and religious control first in Europe (as the revived Roman Empire) and then over the entire world population. This mysterious individual is identified by several names throughout Scripture, including the "lawless one" (2 Thessalonians 2:8&#x2013;9, NIV), the "man of sin" (2 Thessalonians 2:3), "that Wicked" (2 Thessalonians 2:8; 1 John 3:12; 5:18), and even "the mystery of iniquity" (2Thessalonians 2:7). Yet most people know him by the name used by the prophet John, who called him the "antichrist" (see 2 John 7). This completely evil man will embody Satan's ages-long passion to set himself up as god to be worshiped by all of humanity.<br>You and I will live to see the most terrifying dictator in history arise to rule the world. He will embody pure evil, and he will demand that all people worship him as their only god or they will be annihilated.<br>&nbsp;<br>TECHNOLOGY IN THE HANDS OF THE ANTICHRIST<br>&nbsp;<br>In the past it was difficult to understand how any individual could exert complete control over humanity, as is foretold in the Bible. The book of Revelation, for example, describes devastating military attacks from the air, the deliberate poisoning of one-third of the planet's land and water, and the destruction of two-thirds of the earth's population. Serious students of the Bible naturally wondered how these predictions could be fulfilled. Did the prophecies speak of actual future events, or were they only allegorical symbols referring to a spiritual war between the forces of good and evil? In our generation we know enough about warfare, technology, and shifting political allegiances that we can begin to see how one man could exercise such power throughout the world. For the first time in history, it is possible to contemplate the potential for humanity's complete destruction in a global war. In the chapters that follow, we will look at prophecies that describe the Antichrist's rise to power and the nature of the global government that he will control. The Antichrist will become the dominant political, military, and religious figure in the world. God revealed these truths to awaken Christians to the signs of Christ's return to earth, when He will take His followers home to heaven.<br>The rise of the shadow government has significant prophetic implications. The rush to global government, paired with astonishing developments in surveillance technology, will enable the totalitarian regime of the Antichrist to introduce his dreaded Mark of the Beast system. If you know what to look for, you will see all around you measures that could make this system of global control transform into true world government. America's national sovereignty has been progressively eroded. One obvious example, seen almost daily in the news, is the fallout from the threat of global warming. To address this environmental issue, various UN treaties demand that American laws be harmonized with those of other nations in the name of globalization.<br>The issue is much larger than responding to global warming. With the loss of national sovereignty, we will also lose rights and freedoms we now take for granted. Over time, we will no longer enjoy the benefits of free enterprise, and we will lose the guarantees of political, economic, and religious freedom. The leaders that operate behind the scenes have adopted a philosophy of globalism, sharing the desire to become global citizens of the New World Order.<br>&nbsp;<br>YOU ARE BEING WATCHED <br>&nbsp;<br>You don't have to look far to see early indications of our loss of freedom. Following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001, national governments around the world broadened and accelerated spying activities against their own citizens. The creation of a total surveillance society has set the stage for the totalitarian police state described two thousand years ago by the prophet John in the book of Revelation. In later chapters, we will examine the growing use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which is only one step removed from implan...</p><h2>The Water and the Blood: A Novel</h2><p><p><i>I turned and faced the road we'd come down, my face hard and set.

Such is the talent of Nancy E. Turner. Her beloved first novel, <i>These Is My Words</i>, opened readers to the challenges of a woman's life in the nineteenth-century Southwest. Now this extraordinary writer shifts her gaze to a very different world - East Texas in the years of the Second World War - and to the life of a young woman named Philadelphia Summers, known against her will as Frosty.</p><p>From the novel's harrowing opening scene, Frosty's eyes survey the landscape around her - white rural America - with the awestruck clarity of an innocent burned by sin. In her mother and sisters she sees fear and small-mindedness; in the eyes of local boys she sees racial hatred and hunger for war. When that war finally comes, it offers her a chance for escape -to California, and the caring arms of Gordon Benally a Native-American soldier. But when she returns to Texas she must face the rejection of a town still gripped by suspicion - and confront the memory of the crime that has marked her soul since adolescence.</p><p>Propelled by the quiet power of one woman's voice, <i>The Water and the Blood</i> is a moving and unforgettable portrait of an America of haunted women and dangerous fools - an America at once long perished and with us still.</p></p><p><p>Nancy E. Turner's first novel, <em>These Is My Words</em>, was the winner of the Arizona Author Award, and a finalist for the 1999 Willa Gather Award. Turner lives in Tucson, Arizona, with her family.</p><p></p>Turner, the 2001 finalist for the Willa Cather Award (These Is My Words), mesmerizes once again with an East Texas period piece, starring a young heroine who struggles to escape her abusive mother and smalltown limitations. "We set fire to the Nigra church after the Junior-Senior Halloween costume party": unknown to all but one in a motley group of high school friends, this apparently thoughtless act of vandalism in 1942 Sabine, Tex., hides a darker evil that will haunt them all. Philadelphia "Frosty" Summers was there that night, but the lonely girl whose impoverished family had moved seven times in two years said nothing, even though the congregation of that church, the Missionary Way Evangelicle [sic] Temple, had befriended and supported her. Sheriff John Moultrie's efforts to identify the perpetrators, whose innocent "prank" obscures a murder, weave throughout this coming-of-age WWII tale. Narrator Frosty anchors this portrait of repressive Southern religious dogma, racial bigotry, poverty and cruel ignorance. After graduation, Frosty escapes the confines of Sabine by convincing her parents she must travel to southern California to work in a factory to help the war effort. While there she meets and falls in love with Gordon Benally, a Navajo Indian Marine radio operator who is recuperating from wounds received while a POW. Meanwhile, Marty Haliburton, who instigated the long-ago high school "prank," is now the pastor of Frosty's church in Sabine and a member of the KKK. When Frosty and Gordon visit her family, Gordon is judged "colored" and Marty and others try to kill him. Turner's Frosty is a sympathetic young woman, and the supporting characters are vivid and realistic. This beaautifully written portrait of Southern religious repression and racism is a winner. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Gore Vidal History of The National Security State: Includes Vidal on America</h2><p>In Gore Vidal: History of the National Security State &amp; Vidal on America, TRNN Senior Editor Paul Jay and the acclaimed essayist, screenwriter and novelist Gore Vidal discuss the historical events that led to the establishment of the massive military-industrial-security complex and the political culture that gave us the &#x201c;Imperial Presidency.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>This Thing Called You</h2><p>The inspiration of Ernest Holmes has reached hundreds of thousands of readers through his classic works, many of which are just now becoming available in paperback. <br> Originally published in the first half of the twentieth century, these meditative, concise volumes have never previously appeared in paperback.

Except for deadly aim with a handgun, the two couples have little in common until both are hired to do damage control on the same murder case. The previous spring, a body was recovered from a storm sewer after two days of torrential rain.

Grounded in the ancient grandeur and beauty of Hawaii, this collection is a haunted and haunting love song for a beloved homeland under assault.</p><p><b>Haunani-Kay Trask,</b> activist, author, and poet, is professor of Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawai'i.Trask's From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in Hawai'i is a classic of postcolonial studies, but Trask's poetry is also crucial to her activism. Her Light in the Crevice Never Seen is considered the first book of poems published on the mainland by a native Hawaiian, and this follow-up consists of three sections of lyrics, incantation and instigation. The first, "Born in Fire," contains a series of chant-like poems focused on the Hawaiian volcano goddess Pele, who in Trask's work represents a specifically Hawaiian feminine strength. The second, "A Fragrance of Devouring," has poems of complaint about "the common greed/ of vulgar Americans" and about the loss of Hawaiian sovereignty. The poem "Puowaina: Flag Day," begins with a focus on plants rich in Hawaiian symbol (a glossary is provided) as it urges readers to "Bring lei hulu,/ palapalai, pikake. Bring/ kapa, beaten fine" and then ends "and burn/ their American/ flag." Yet Trask doesn't find many takers for her exhortations, and laments what the poet perceives as apathy among Hawaiians: "The natives don't/ horde small fortunes/ for revolution's/ duty. They sit,/ observing the parade." Things get ugly in a poem that describes Daniel Inouye, the U.S. senator from Hawai'i, as the "Japanese senator, smugly/ armless from the great war/ preposterous manikin/ of empire, feigning an accent." Yet the third and strongest section, "Chants of Dawn," is composed of love poems and celebrations of the land-often in spare stanzas that travel "Into our sovereign suns,/ drunk on the mana/ of Hawai'i." It is these poems that best highlight Trask's craft and defiance. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life at Home in the Twenty-First Century: 32 Families Open Their Doors</h2><p><p><em>Winner of the 2014 John Collier Jr. Award </em></p><p><em>Winner of the Jo Anne Stolaroff Cotsen Prize</em></p><p><em>Life at Home in the Twenty-First Century</em> cross-cuts the ranks of important books on social history, consumerism, contemporary culture, the meaning of material culture, domestic architecture, and household ethnoarchaeology.

This is the landmark watering hole where Abraham Lincoln campaigned and Boss Tweed kicked back with the Tammany Hall machine. Where a pair of Houdini's handcuffs found their final resting place. And where soldiers left behind wishbones before departing for the First World War, never to return and collect them. Many of the bar's traditions remain intact, from the newspaper-covered walls to the plates of cheese and raw onions, the sawdust-strewn floors to the tall-tales told by its bartenders.<b></b><br><br>But in addition to the bar's rich history, McSorley's is home to a deeply personal story about two men: Rafe Bartholomew, the writer who grew up in the landmark pub, and his father, Geoffrey "Bart" Bartholomew, a career bartender who has been working the taps for forty-five years.<br><br>On weekends, Rafe Bartholomew would tag along for the early hours of his dad's shift, polishing brass doorknobs, watching over the bar cats, and handling other odd jobs until he grew old enough to join Bart behind the bar. McSorley's was a place of bizarre rituals, bawdy humor, and tasks as unique as the bar itself: protecting the decades-old dust that had gathered on treasured artifacts; shot-putting thirty-pound grease traps into high-walled Dumpsters; and trying to keep McSorley's open through the worst of Hurricane Sandy. But for Rafe, the bar means home. It's the place where he and his father have worked side by side, serving light and dark ale, always in pairs, the way it's always been done. Where they've celebrated victories, like the publication of his father's first book of poetry, and coped with misfortune, like the death of Rafe's mother. Where Rafe learned to be part of something bigger than himself and also how to be his own man.<br><br>By turns touching, crude, and wildly funny, Rafe's story reveals universal truths about family, loss, and the bursting history of one of New York's most beloved institutions.</p><p>Rafe Bartholomew is the author of <em>Pacific Rims. </em>He was one of the original editors of <i>Grantland, </i>where he wrote and edited sports features from 2011 to 2015, and his work has appeared in <em>Slate,</em> the<em> New York Times,</em> the <em>Chicago Reader, Deadspin </em>and other leading online and print publications. Several of his stories have been honored in the <em>Best American Sports Writing </em>series. He lives in Los Angeles.<strong>Praise for <em>Two and Two</em></strong><br><br>"This is more than a story about a famous speakeasy where, for the price of a beer, you can still sit at the same tables where great writers like Joseph Mitchell, Eugene O'Neill, and e.e. Cummings once sat and ruminated. This is a story about a father and son, both of whom toiled for years amidst the ghosts a hundred years past, when a group of hard working Irish Americans created one of New York's greatest institutions with nothing more than sweat, beer, liverwurst sandwiches, and an occasional punch in the nose to all spoilers and bullies. <br><br>"Many a day I have sat in McSorley's amidst the sawdust and beer and said to myself, 'You'd have to be a child of this place to make these ghosts speak.' And that is exactly what Rafe Bartholomew is. His is the voice of ages, the shouts of thousands of fireman, cops, soldiers, drunks, bums, wayfarers, liars, and good souls whose hard luck brought them to McSorley's, and whose good spirit still reign over the place. He hoists this wonderful piece of Americana into the air with all the humor, joy, humility and love that it deserves."&#x2015;<b><i>James McBride, author of <em>The Color of Water</em> and <em>The Good Lord Bird</em></i></b><br><br>"Rafe Bartholomew has written a smart, moving book for the inner New Yorker (and inner barfly) in all of us. His father-not to mention Old John McSorley himself-should be damned proud."&#x2015;<b><i>Tom Bissell, author of <em>Apostle</em> and <em>Extra Lives</em></i></b><br><br>"In <i>Two and Two</i>, Rafe Bartholomew has not just lovingly crafted an homage to a singular American place of drink, but also given us a steady look into the intense realm of father and son. This memoir pulses with uncommon talent."&#x2015;<b><i>William Giraldi, author of <em>The Hero's Body</em> and <em>Hold the Dark</em></i></b><br><br>"Rafe's like a brother to me. So to read this book is to discover a childhood I never knew he had (never knew any kid could have!) and a dad I can't wait to meet. Rafe presents both with enviable, high-definition affection. This is a biography of a father and the bar that became part of his soul. It's a memoir of a son the bar co-parented. It's history of New York City and a sly, considered essay on masculinity. It's a book quietly about a mythic America that simultaneously never really existed yet, obviously, totally did. Rafe's writing, his memories, his sensitivity and sweetness made me laugh. They <i>moved</i> me. In my years living in New York, I never thought of a bar like McSorley's as a bar for me. The hefty beauty and lasting surprise of this book is how it reminds me over and over that I was probably - maybe certainly - wrong."&#x2015;<b><i>Wesley Morris, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism</i></b><br><br>"Quite simply the best thing I've read about fathers and sons (Turgenev, eat your heart out)."&#x2015;<b><i>Lawrence Block, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author</i></b><br><br>A "big-hearted memoir of a lifelong romance with New York City's oldest (continuously operating) saloon... a watering hole for artists, politicians, and oddballs, a storehouse of oral tradition passed through generations of staff...

We found a great number of books in these letters and since they contained nothing but superstitions and falsehoods of the devil we burned them all, which they took most grievously, and which gave them great pain.</i><br>So writes Friar Diego de Landa in his <i>Relaci�n De las cosas de Yucatan</i> of 1566, the basic book in Maya studies. Landa did all he could to wipe out Maya culture and civilization. In the famous auto da f� of July 1562 at Man�, as he tells us, he destroyed 5,000 "idols" and burned 27 hieroglyphic rolls. And yet paradoxically Landa's book, written in Spain to defend himself against charges of despotic mismanagement, is the only significant account of Yucatan done in the early post-Conquest era. As the distinguished Maya scholar William Gates states in his introduction, "ninety-nine percent of what we today know of the Mayas, we know as the result either of what Landa has told us in the pages that follow, or have learned in the use and study of what he told." <i>Yucatan Before and After the Conquest</i> is the first English translation of this very important work.<br>Landa's book gives us a full account of Maya customs, daily activities, history, ceremonial festivals, and the many social and communal functions in which their life was expressed. Included here are the geography and natural history of Yucatan, the history of the Conquest, indigenous architecture and other aspects of Maya civilization (sciences, books, religion, etc.), native historical traditions, the Inquisition instituted by the Spanish clergy, Maya clothing, food, commerce, agriculture, human sacrifices, calendrical lore, and much more.</p><p>Text: English, Spanish (translation)Only significant account done of Yucatan In post-Conquest era.

Visionary and prophetic, <b>The Shield of Achilles</b> looks back at history, at the &#x201c;Long War&#x201d; of 1914-1990, and at the future: the death of the nation-state and the birth of a new kind of conflict without precedent.</p><p>The scope of Philip Bobbitt's <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is breathtaking: the interplay, over the last six centuries, among war, jurisprudence, and the reshaping of countries ("states," in Bobbitt's vocabulary). Bobbitt posits that certain wars should be deemed epochal--that is, seen as composed of many "smaller" wars. For example, according to Bobbitt the epochal war of the 20th century began in 1914 and ended with the collapse of communism in 1990. These military affairs--and their subsequent "ultimate" peace agreements--have caused, each in their own way, revolutionary reconstructions of the idea and actuality of statehood and, following, of relationships between these various new entities. Of these reconstructions (including the princely state, the kingly state, and the nation-state), Bobbitt is most interested in the current incarnation, which he calls the market-state: one whose borders are scuffed and hazy at best (certainly compared to earlier territorial markers) and whose strengths, weaknesses, citizens, and enemies roam across cyberspace rather than plains and valleys. <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is massive, erudite, and demanding--at once highly abstract and extremely detailed. There is about it an air of detached erudition, one noticeably free of the easy "decline and fall" hysteria too often present in contemporary historical analyses. <i>--H.

While Grisham is best known as the raucous and provocative front man of the pioneer hardcore punk band TSOL (True Sounds of Liberty), his writing and true life experiences are physically and psychologically more complex, unsettling, and violent than those of Bret Easton Ellis and Chuck Palahniuk. Eloquently disregarding the prefabricated formulas of the drunk-to-sober, bad-to-good tale, this is an entirely new kind of life lesson: summoned through both God and demons, while settling within eighties hardcore punk culture and its radical-to-the-core (and most assuredly non-evangelical) parables, Grisham leads us, cleverly, gorgeously, between temporal violence and bigger-picture spirituality toward something very much like a path to salvation and enlightenment. An American Demon flourishes on both extremes, as a scary hardcore punk memoir and as a valuable message to souls navigating through an overly materialistic and woefully self-absorbed me first&#x201d; modern society. An American Demon conveys anger and truth within the perfect setting, using a youth rebellion that changed the world to open doors for this level of brash destruction. Told from the point of view of a seminal member of the American Punk movement doused in violence, rebellion, alcoholism, drug abuse, and ending with beautiful lessons of sobriety and absolution this book is as harrowing and life-affirming as anything you&#x2019;re ever going to read.</p></p><p>Now in heavy demand as a public speaker, Jack Grisham currently receives thousands of calls a month from individuals and organizations seeking his advice, expertise, wit, mentorship, and support, especially on drug and alcohol&#x2013;related issues.

What was once a crucial tool for photographers to test their shots before shooting on film has now become obsolete in the face of digital photography. Luckily for us, legendary photographer Helmut Newton saved his test Polaroids, allowing a privileged and rare chance to see the tests from a selection of his greatest shoots over a period of decades, including many from the TASCHEN titles <em>SUMO, A Gun for Hire</em>, and <em>Work</em>. Selected by his widow, June Newton, from over 300 photos featured at the 2011 exhibition "Helmut Newton Polaroids" at the Museum f�r Fotografie in Berlin, this collection captures the magic of Helmut Newton photo shoots as only Polaroids can. &nbsp; Text in English, French, and German</p><p>Helmut Newton (1920-2004) was one of the most influential photographers of all time. Born in Berlin, he arrived in Australia in 1940 and married June Brunell (a.k.a. Alice Springs) eight years later. He first achieved international fame in the 1970&#39;s while working principally for French Vogue, and his celebrity and influence grew over the decades. Newton preferred to shoot in streets or interiors, rather than studios. Controversial scenarios, bold lighting, and striking compositions came to form his signature look. In 1990 he was awarded the Grand Prix national de la photographie; in 1992 the German government awarded him Das Grosse Verdienstkreuz for services to German culture, and he was appointed Officier des Arts, Lettres et Sciences by S.A.S. Princess Caroline of Monaco. In 1996, he was appointed Commandeur de l&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French Minister of Culture at the time. Working and living in close companionship with his wife until his death at 83, his images remain as distinctive, seductive and orginal as ever.</p><h2>Machimaho: I Messed Up and Made the Wrong Person Into a Magical Girl!

At the request of the local rabbis, Polish authorities arrested the participants. Jewish authorities contacted the bishop in whose diocese the service had taken place and argued that since the rites of Frank's followers involved the practice of magic and immoral conduct, both Jews and Christians should condemn them and burn them at the stake. The scheme backfired, as the Frankists took the opportunity to ally themselves with the Church, presenting themselves as Contra-Talmudists who believed in a triune God. As a Turkish subject, Frank was released and temporarily expelled to the Ottoman territories, but the others were found guilty of breaking numerous halakhic prohibitions and were subject to a Jewish ban of excommunication. While they professed their adherence to everything that was commanded by God in the Old Testament, they asserted as well that the Rabbis of old had introduced innumerable lies and misconstructions in their interpretations of that holy book.</p><p>Who were Jacob Frank and his followers? To most Christians, they seemed to be members of a Jewish sect; to Jewish reformers, they formed a group making a valiant if misguided attempt to bring an end to the power of the rabbis; and to more traditional Jews, they were heretics to be suppressed by the rabbinate. What is undeniable is that by the late eighteenth century, the Frankists numbered in the tens of thousands and had a significant political and ideological influence on non-Jewish communities throughout eastern and central Europe.</p><p>Based on extensive archival research in Poland, the Czech Republic, Israel, Germany, the United States, and the Vatican, <i>The Mixed Multitude</i> is the first comprehensive study of Frank and Frankism in more than a century and offers an important new perspective on Jewish-Christian relations in the Age of Enlightenment.</p></p><p>Pawel Maciejko is Lecturer in Jewish Thought at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<p>Introduction</p><p>Conversions to Christianity were among the most traumatic events in the history of medieval and early modern Jewish communities. Jews regarded baptism as a "betrayal of communal values, a rejection of Jewish destiny, a submission to the illusory verdict of history." Willing apostates were seen as the worst traitors and renegades, forced conversions were considered the ultimate form of persecution of Israel by the Gentiles, and, according to the common ideal, it was better to choose a martyr's death than to submit to the power of the Church. Each soul that Judaism lost was mourned. The dominant narrative did not even entertain the possibility that a Jew might embrace Christianity without any threat or ulterior motive. Christians themselves, while officially praising the apostates and expressing hope for "the blind synagogue's" future recognition of the "obvious" truth of Christianity, privately voiced doubts concerning the sincerity of the converts and the very ability of the Jews to truly accept Christ.</p><p>In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the largest Catholic country in Europe and, at the same time, the home of the largest Jewish community in premodern times, baptisms of Jews were rare. Neither the local church nor the state conducted systematic missionary campaigns targeting the Jews. Forced conversions of individuals were forbidden by law and were few. Mass apostasies, like those known in Western Europe, did not occur-with one significant exception. In late summer and early autumn 1759, a sizable group of Jews-thousands, by most accounts-led by one Jacob Frank embraced Roman Catholicism in the city of Lw�w. The conversion was unique not only in its sheer size. It was also-or at least appeared to be-voluntary: whatever caused Frank and his followers to approach the baptismal font, they were not facing a choice between baptism and expulsion or violent death like their brethren in medieval German lands or Portugal. What was most unusual, however, was the reaction of most Jewish contemporaries. In contrast to typical reactions of sadness, anger, or despair, many Jews saw the conversion of Frank and his group as a God-given miracle and a great victory for Judaism. Entire communities celebrated.</p><p>Among early Jewish accounts of the 1759 conversion, only one departed from the prevailing triumphant mood and expressed radically different sentiments. Israel Ba'al Shem Tov, known as the BeSh"T (1698-1760), who was the founder of Hasidism, the most important spiritual movement in Judaism of the period, was said to have bemoaned the Lw�w mass apostasy or even to have died of pain caused by it. According to the story recorded in the hagiographic collection <i>Shivhe ha-BeSh"T</i>, the Ba'al Shem Tov laid the blame for the eruption of the entire affair on the Jewish establishment; he was "very angry with the rabbis and said that it was because of them, since they invented lies of their own." The leader of Hasidism saw Frank and his group as part of the mystical body of Israel and presented their baptism as the amputation of a limb from the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence on earth: "I heard from the rabbi of our community that concerning those who converted [in Lw�w], the Besht said: As long as the member is connected, there is some hope that it will recover, but when the member is cut off, there is no repair possible. Each person of Israel is a member of the <i>Shekhinah</i>."</p><p>The Ba'al Shem Tov died in 1760, a year after the Lw�w apostasy. Some 150 years later, in Berlin, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, an aspiring writer who was later to become the State of Israel's most celebrated author and a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote a short essay on Frank. He juxtaposed various Jewish accounts of the 1759 conversion, ending his piece with the testimony concerning the BeSh"T's words. He concluded:</p><blockquote>We are only dust under the feet of this holy man, yet we dare to be of another opinion. Frank and his gang were not a limb of the body of Israel; rather, they were a [pathological] excrescence. Praise and thanks to our doctors, who cut it off in time, before it took root in the body!... Undoubtedly, Frank and his group were descendants of the foreign rabble, which tacked itself onto Israel during the Exodus from Egypt, and followed it thereafter. In the desert, in the Land of Israel, and later in the Exile, this multitude defiled the purity of Israel and defiled its holiness. May we be freed from them forever! </blockquote>In recounting the BeSh"T's reaction to Frank's conversion, Agnon alluded to the symbolism of the "mixed rabble" or "mixed multitude," the <i>erev rav</i>. The concept appears in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative account of the Exodus (Exod. 12:37-38): "And the People of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot, who were men, beside children. And a mixed multitude [<i>erev rav</i>] went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, and very many cattle." Jewish tradition interpreted the phrase <i>erev rav</i> as denoting a group of foreigners who joined the Israelites following Moses from Egypt. While some midrashim understood it as a reference to the "righteous among the Egyptians, who celebrated Passover together with Israel," a prototype for future converts to Judaism, the majority of rabbinic exegetes saw in the mixed multitude the source of corruption, sin, and discord: accustomed to idolatry, the <i>erev rav</i> enticed Israelites to make the Golden Calf and angered God by demanding the abolition of the prohibition of incest. Thus, the emblem of the <i>erev rav</i> came to evoke the image of unwelcome strangers present in the very midst of the Holy People; the mixed multitude were not true "children of Abraham" but Egyptian rabble who mingled with Israelites, contaminated their purity, incited them to sin, and caused them to stray from the right path in the wilderness. It was because of them that the generation of the Exodus lost the right path on the desert and Moses did not enter the Land of Israel.<p></p><p>In the Middle Ages, the symbolism established by the ancient midrash was taken up and developed by kabbalah, particularly the book of the Zohar. The Zohar universalized the midrashic image by removing it from its original place in the sequence of biblical narrative: the presence and activity of the mixed multitude were not restricted to the generation of the Exodus but extended over the entire history of humanity. The <i>erev rav</i> were the impurity that the serpent injected into Eve; they were the descendants of Cain; the <i>nefilim</i>, "sons of God" who procreated with the daughters of men (Gen. 6:2-4); the wicked ones who survived the deluge. They were progeny of the demonic rulers, Samael and Lilith. They contributed to the building of the Tower of Babel and caused the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple. They practiced incest, idolatry, and witchcraft. They were the cause of the imprisonment of the Divine Presence in the demonic realm of the "husks" (<i>kelippot</i>) and, likewise, the exile of Israel among the nations.</p><p>In the Zohar's narrative, the activity of the mixed multitude was by no means restricted to the past. Rather, the <i>erev rav</i> represented the ever-present force of destruction, whose aim was to bring the world back to the state of biblical "waste and void," the primordial chaos (<i>tohu va-vohu</i>). And, it should be noted, this force was located within the Jewish people. As the mixed multitude mingled with Israelites in the desert, their descendants became outwardly undistinguishable from other Jews and existed in every generation: in accordance with its wider mythology of metempsychosis, the Zohar depicted present-day Jewish sinners as Jews the "roots of whose souls" originated among the <i>erev rav</i>.</p><p>The topos of the mixed multitude thus became the figure of the ultimate enemy within, as opposed to Gentile haters of Israel. As Yitzhak Baer has demonstrated, in its original Zoharic setting, this motif had already been employed as a vehicle of a powerful social critique directed against the contemporary Jewish establishment, which was said to oppress scholars and abuse the poor. The rabbis and <i>parnassim</i> (lay leaders), who "studied Torah not for its own sake," "erected synagogues not for the glory of God but rather to make a name for themselves," and turned into "false shepherds of Israel," were surely not "true children of Israel" but the descendants of the Egyptian hangers-on who had joined Moses in the wilderness. Thus, the rich, powerful, materialistic rabbinic and secular powers were contrasted with holy spiritualists lacking riches or high social position and extolling poverty for the sake of God. In the eyes of kabbalists, only the latter formed the true congregation of Israel.</p><p>The Jews who converted in Lw�w in 1759 were Sabbatians-followers of a religious movement triggered by messianic claims of the Ottoman Jew Sabbatai Tsevi (1626-76). Sabbatai first voiced his pretensions to the messiahship in 1648, but the movement that formed around him began to gain momentum only in 1665, when a young kabbalist, Nathan of Gaza (1643-80), "recognized" the truth of his mandate in an ecstatic vision. Shortly after proclaiming Sabbatai as the messiah, Nathan-who was soon to become "at once the John the Baptist and the Paul of the new messiah" -composed a commentary on an ancient apocalyptic text that he had supposedly discovered in an old synagogue's storage room. In order to counter rabbinic opposition to the budding messianic upheaval, he invoked the symbolism of the mixed multitude: the messiah's contemporaries "shall rise against him with reproaches and blasphemies-they are the 'mixed multitude,' the sons of Lilith, the 'caul above the liver' [Lev. 3:4], the leaders and rabbis of the generation."</p><p>In his subsequent writings, Nathan developed a doctrine of salvation attainable by messianic belief alone (as opposed to the observance of commandments) and extended his use of the motif of the <i>erev rav</i> claiming that all Jews who fully observed the Law but denied Sabbatai's mandate had souls of the mixed multitude. As Gershom Scholem observed, by linking the symbolism of the mixed multitude with eschatology and messianic mysteries, Nathan combined two distinct motifs that function separately in the Zohar. For the Sabbatians, the litmus test of what was the root of one's soul became not, as in the Zohar, spiritual piety and "observance of the Torah for its own sake" but faith in the messiah Sabbatai Tsevi (or lack thereof): the sectarians "increasingly felt themselves to be the true Israel, harassed by the 'mixed multitude' because of their faith."</p><p>The radical dichotomy between the messianic believers and the rabbinic skeptics was further elaborated in the <i>Commentary on the Midnight-Vigil Liturgy</i>, composed by Nathan's disciple Rabbi Israel Hazzan of Kastoria. Hazzan argued that the true messiah would be recognized not by the Jewish leaders, whom he defined as the progeny of the mixed multitude, but by simpletons. The denial of Sabbatai Tsevi as the messiah and the failure to understand hints about him in the Jewish canon came to be attributed to a kind of metaphysical blindness stemming from the very roots of the nonbelievers' souls. According to the Sabbatians, the "pretended rabbis" could no longer assert any rights to leadership over the Jewish people or lay claims to the authoritative interpretation of Jewish tradition. Their learning was false, their worldly position based on abuses of power, their ostensible piety worthless and lacking deeper sense.</p><p>As Nathan of Gaza and Israel Hazzan composed their polemics against the rabbis, detractors of the new messiah attempted to turn the tables on the Sabbatians. Rabbi Jacob Sasportas, the preeminent adversary of early Sabbatianism, heard about Nathan's statements. Angered by the preposterous claims that the very cream of the cream of the rabbinic elite consisted of descendants of the mixed multitude, Sasportas proclaimed that it was not the leaders of the generation but the Sabbatians themselves whose souls originated among the <i>erev rav</i>. In a short time, the symbolic opposition of the "mixed multitude" and the "true Israelites" permanently entered the lexicon of the debate between the Sabbatians and their opponents. This became especially pronounced in the eighteenth century and in the documents directly concerning Frank. In one of the first accounts of the Lw�w conversion, Ber Birkenthal of Bolech�w reported that "they call us [the anti-Sabbatians] the <i>erev rav</i>, and their faction they call the <i>mahaneh</i> [company, fellowship]." Frank's most important competitor for leadership over all the Eastern and Central European Sabbatians, Wolf Eibesch�tz, also defined the conflict between the sectarians and the rabbinate as a struggle between <i>bne mehimenuta</i> (children of the faith) and the children of the <i>erev rav</i>.</p><p>On the other side of the barricade, Rabbi Jacob Emden, the most zealous anti-Sabbatian of the period, interpreted Frank's baptism as the final severance of the <i>erev rav</i> from the chosen people, so that the purified Israel might taste from the Tree of Life and achieve redemption. Shortly after the conversion of the Frankists, Emden composed a laudatory poem praising God for "separating between the unclean and the pure . between us and the mixed multitude, who tried to bring the world back to its antediluvian state."</p><p>The issue was not merely terminological and went far beyond the mutual mudslinging. The dichotomy between the true Israel and the mixed multitude constituted the major conceptual axis of the theological controversies that tore apart eighteenth-century Judaism. Approximately a century after the advent of Sabbatai Tsevi, most debates concerning Sabbatianism (and, more broadly, Jewish heterodoxy) did not revolve around messianism, let alone Sabbatai's specific messianic claims. Rather, the disputes concentrated on the limits of religion and conditions for belonging to the Jewish people. Each side considered only its own version of Judaism legitimate and claimed to be the one true Israel. Each party branded the other as "progeny of the mixed multitude," implicitly denying its Jewishness. Thus the discourse of the mixed multitude endeavored to establish the boundaries of Judaism and of the Jewish people independently of the traditional halakhic criteria of who is a Jew: within the framework of this discourse, certain groups of people might have been "externally" Jewish for generations but were said to remain alien in the depths of their souls. By drawing a line between those whose souls originated from "children of Abraham" and those who came from the <i>erev rav</i>, the Sabbatian debate aimed to distinguish between the "real" Jews and pseudo-Jews, "true" Judaism and false faith. Frankism, the movement that crystallized around Jacob Frank in the 1750s, was the last-and, in many ways, most dramatic-word in this debate.</p><p>Sabbatianism in the Eighteenth Century</p><p>The beginning of Sabbatianism was Sabbatai Tsevi's messianic self-revelation and the prophecies of Nathan of Gaza. The news of the messiah's advent spread like wildfire through Jewish communities in the Ottoman Empire and Europe and, for a brief period, the majority of the Jewish p...</p></p><h2>The Morganville Vampires, Vol. 3</h2><p><b>Now in one volume-two of <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Rachel Caine's Morganville Vampire novels. </b> <br><br> <i>Lord of Misrule</i> <br><br> In Morganville, violent black clouds promise a storm of devastating proportions.

According to Kate Strohm, a counselor and health educator, siblings of the disabled face particular emotional challenges that are often overlooked. Able siblings commonly struggle with feelings of isolation, grief, anger, and anxiety&#x2014;and these and other emotional issues can have lifelong effects. <br><br> <i>Being the Other One </i> is based on the author's own experience (as a sibling of a sister with cerebral palsy) and on extensive interviews she conducted with siblings of all ages. In clear and compassionate terms, Strohm explores the often secret feelings of siblings and offers valuable strategies for coping with the challenges they face. <br><br> <i>Being the Other One </i> reveals the difficulties faced by siblings at all stages of life, from early childhood through adulthood, when siblings must often assume responsibility for the care of their disabled brothers and sisters. Though the book looks honestly at the many challenges that siblings face, it is full of encouragement and practical strategies. Strohm emphasizes that when siblings are able to clearly identify and openly express their feelings and concerns&#x2014;and when parents and health professionals offer the needed support&#x2014;siblings can thrive. This book includes writing exercises for personal exploration and a substantial resources section listing helpful books, organizations, and websites.</p><p>Kate Strohm is a counselor, health educator, and journalist. She is the director of Siblings Australia, a program that provides resources and support for siblings of children with special needs, as well as for their families and health care providers. She is a sibling herself to a sister with cerebral palsy."Insightful and informative, honest and heartening, <i>Being the Other One </i> is an empowering guide that illuminates the lifelong challenges faced by the siblings of people with disabilities. Whether you're a parent, a professional, or, like Kate Strohm herself, a sibling, you reach for this book again and again, finding both support and solutions in its pages."&#x2014;Rachel Simon, author of <i>Riding the Bus with My Sister: A True Life Journey </i> <br><br>"This book really made me think.

But he had ignored them. He had made his kill. And even as he went to collect his gold, he knew that he had been betrayed.<br>Now the Dark Brotherhood and the hounds of chaos were hunting him, even as Kaem's armies waged war on the Drenai lands, intent on killing every man, woman, and child. The Drenai soldiers were doomed to ultimate defeat, and chaos would soon reign. <br>Then a strange old man told Waylander that the only way to turn the tide of battle would be for Waylander himself to retrieve the legendary Armor of Bronze from its hiding place deep within a shadow-haunted land. He would be hunted. He was certain to fail. But he must try, the old man commanded--commanded in the name of his son, the king, who had been slain by an assassin... <br>Waylander was the most unlikely of heroes--for he was a traitor, the Slayer who had killed the king...</p><p>David Gemmell is so committed to his work that he's offered to leap naked out of an airplane if it would appeal to readers. We haven't taken him up on the offer. However, David has also acknowledged that three of his major influences were Louis Lamour, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Stan Lee. Tolkien wrote back, Lamour passed away before David had any opportunity to contact him, and Stan Lee lived thousands of miles away from David's British home. One out of three wasn't bad, but it could be improved upon.<br><br>We were at the San Diego ComicCon, rustling up new readers, and David had just finished a two-hour continuous signing. A friend of mine spotted a familiar face, so I excused myself and darted away, returning a few moments later to say, "David Gemmell, I'd like you to meet Stan Lee." A tall, ruddy, and normally poised individual, David was struck speechless. Here was the man who, through his Marvel Comics stories, had reinvented the relationship between heroes and villains, forever blurring the barriers between good and evil. Before long the two fantasists were chatting away happily. Stan's wife, Joan, being British, was especially gracious to the London-born Gemmell. And Stan quickly demanded an autographed copy of LEGEND.<br><br>David's a dynamic storyteller. His lands live and breathe. His heroes are mighty swordsmen, ax-wielders, and post-apocalyptic adventurers. In their prime they were the best in the business, but in David's tales, they've often passed their prime, so all they really want is peace and quiet. But life (and the author) aren't that kind, and these heroes are forced out of retirement, forced to face bloody hordes of the undead, armies from Hell. Worse, his heroes are generally saddled with young, green heroes. (Nothing drives you crazy more than a cocky kid.) But they overcome, and the cocky kids become heroes, too. This is great reading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Steve Saffel, Senior EditorDavid Gemmell&#39;s first novel, Legend, was published in 1984 and he was widely acclaimed as Britain&#39;s king of heroic fantasy.

Caitlin Matthews' scholarship connects us to past, present, and future in the very depths of our femininity. ----Marion Woodman, Jungian analyst and author of <i>Bone: Dying into Life</i>. Sophia, or "wisdom" in Greek, has been revered in many forms throughout history--from the Dark Goddess of ancient Anatolia; to her Egyptian, Greek, Celtic, and Cabalistic manifestations; to her current forms as Mary and the orthodox St. Sophia. In the <i>Gnostic Gospel of Thomas</i>, Sophia sits with God until the creation. Then she falls into matter and becomes manifest in every atom, permeating all things "like the sparks that run through charcoal," as Matthews says. While God is "out there," the Goddess is "in here"-- the mother-wit of practical inspiration and compassion at the heart's core. This definitive work comprehensively establishes a realistic Goddess theology for Westerners in the twenty-first century: grounding spirituality in daily life and the natural world; learning to work playfully and play seriously; ending the gender war to enjoy sacred marriage.</p><p>A classic from the day it was published in 1991, <i>Sophia: The Goddess of Wisdom</i> is an intensely scholarly yet highly poetic work. Modern history (his story) may have buried the Great Goddess under suffocating layers of denial and revisionism, yet as we move deeper into the "sophianic millennium," scraping away the fallow ground of patriarchy, She emerges anew. Author Caitlin Matthews unveils the veiled Black Goddess (the primal manifestation of the Divine Feminine) in her many hiding places over the last several thousand years. Disempowered and hacked to pieces, she has survived in the major Western religions, philosophies, and mystery schools in many guises. With the aid of the author's trained and intuitive eye, the reader tracks Her faint footsteps through the long dark night of the feminine soul. Along with <i>The White Goddess</i> by Robert Graves, this book is a must-read for those who wish to understand why the Goddess fled, where She went, and how we can reaffirm Her as the giver of practical and spiritual wisdom--celebrating Her primacy in the manifestation of all things. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>Caitl�n Matthews is internationally acknowledged for her exposition of Celtic spiritual traditions. She teaches practical applications of the ancestral and shamanic lore of Britain, Ireland and Europe worldwide.

Six chapters address each of these treasures in turn, discussing how to find them, equipment needed, methodologies, and some safety guidelines and codes of conduct. Some history is thrown in throughout, and a scattering of personal stories and interviews adds a personal touch. While Walsh states that the &#x201c;best treasure hunters work from feelings of intuition, which means that you just know something without really knowing why,&#x201d; she also points kids to local resources for finding treasures that don&#x2019;t rely on intuition, and a bibliography at the end provides other informational sources to consult. While the text often highlights the state of Maine, the ideas and advice presented could apply in almost any area.

The Red Armys counteroffensive, Operation Uranus, is well underway, having largely destroyed the bulk of two Romanian armies and encircled the German Sixth and half of the German Fourth Panzer Army.<br><br>Drawing on materials previously unavailable or believed lost, Glantz gives a closely observed account of the final ten weeks of Germanys ill-fated Stalingrad campaign. In short order, the Red Army parried and then defeated two German attempts to rescue the Sixth Army, crushed the Italian Eighth and Hungarian Second Armies, severely damaged the German Fourth Panzer and Second Armies, and finally destroyed the German Sixth Army in the ruins of Stalingrad. With well over half-a-million soldiers torn from its order of battle, Hitlers Axis could only watch in horror as its status abruptly changed from victor to vanquished. This book completes a vivid and detailed picture of the Axis defeat that would prove decisive as a catastrophe from which Germany and its Wehrmacht could never recover.<br><br>As in the preceding volumes, Glantz extensively mines newly available materials to provide a clearer and more accurate picture of what actually happened at Stalingrad at this crucial moment in World War II&#x2014;a ground truth that gets beyond the myths and misinformation surrounding this historic confrontation. And this concluding chapter, relating events even more steeped in myth than those that came before, is especially bracing as it takes on controversial questions about why Operation Uranus succeeded and the German relief attempts failed, whether the Sixth Army could have escaped encirclement or been rescued, and who, finally was most responsible for its ultimate defeat. The answers Glantz provides, embedded in a fully-realized account of the endgame at Stalingrad, make this book the last word on one of historys epic clashes.</p><p>David M. Glantz and Jonathan M. House have collaborated on all three volumes of the Stalingrad Trilogy, as well as on the books When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler and The Battle of Kursk. A retired U. S. Army colonel fluent in Russian, Glantz is the author of numerous books, including The Battle for Leningrad, 19411944; Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War, and Red Storm over the Balkans: The Failed Soviet Invasion of Romania. House is the author of Combined Arms Warfare in the Twentieth Century."A top-down treatment of battle planning and maneuvering of forces by high-level staff and commanders, with the detailed order of battle and statistical information one has come to expect from David Glantz and Jonathan House."&#x2014;<i><b>The Historian</b></i><p>"The team of Glantz and House has once again collaborated and has successfully completed the superb trilogy on Stalingrad."&#x2014;<i><b>Army History</b></i></p><p>"Fifteen years ago the late John Erickson wrote that the research of Glantz and house reflected an &#x2018;encyclopaedic knowledge&#x2019; of the Nazi-Soviet war and constituted a benchmark for excellence in the field. The Stalingrad trilogy reflects the fact that they maintain that standard, while bringing to light a new understanding of many old questions."&#x2014;<b><i>War in History</i></b></p><p>"After providing us with the magisterial <i>When Titans Clashed</i>, Glantz and House have now supplemented this account with a masterful documentation of Stalingrad."&#x2014;<b><i>The Russian Review</i></b></p><p>Glantz is the world&#x2019;s top scholar of the Soviet-German War.&#x2014;<b><i>Journal of Military History</i></b></p><p>"David Glantz has done something very few historians achieve.

Told in a succession of short and powerful poems, it takes us deep into the cyclone of the narrator&#x2019;s emotions: despair, anger, guilt, resentment, and ultimately, acceptance.</p></p><p>The subtitle of <i>Stop Pretending</i> says it all: "What Happened When My Big Sister Went Crazy." In a sequence of short, intense poems based on the author's own experiences, a 13-year-old girl suffers through her shifting feelings about her sibling's mental illness. She recalls the terror of the Christmas Eve when Sister was suddenly transformed into a stranger; the horror of visiting Sister in the hospital and finding her rocking on all fours; the fear that her friends will find out; her own worry that she, too, may lose her mind; and her wistful memories of Sister as she was before. More complex emotions are also explored, such as her irrational suspicion that Sister may be deliberately acting crazy, as poignantly expressed in the title poem: "Stop pretending./ Right this minute./ Don't you tell me/ you don't know me./ Stop this crazy act/ and show me/ that you haven't changed./ Stop pretending/ you're deranged." Gradually, as Sister begins to recover, the girl is able to find hope and again take pleasure in her own life. Blank verse is perfect for a story with such heightened emotion, and is a format that has been used with great success in other fine novels for teens, notably the Newbery-award winning <i>Out of the Dust</i>, by Karen Hesse, and Robert Cormier's boyhood memoir, <i>Frenchtown Summer</i>. Teen readers may even be so inspired as to try their own hand at this challenging but satisfying form.

In his last book, <i>Quantitative Value</i>, author Wes Gray brought systematic value strategy from the hedge funds to the masses; in this book, he does the same for momentum investing, the system that has been shown to beat the market and regularly enriches the coffers of Wall Street's most sophisticated investors. First, you'll learn what momentum investing is <i>not</i>: it's not 'growth' investing, nor is it an esoteric academic concept. You may have seen it used for asset allocation, but this book details the ways in which momentum stands on its own as a stock selection strategy, and gives you the expert insight you need to make it work for you. You'll dig into its behavioral psychology roots, and discover the key tactics that are bringing both institutional and individual investors flocking into the momentum fold. </p><p>Systematic investment strategies always seem to look good on paper, but many fall down in practice. Momentum investing is one of the few systematic strategies with legs, withstanding the test of time and the rigor of academic investigation. This book provides invaluable guidance on constructing your own momentum strategy from the ground up. </p><ul> <li>Learn what momentum is and is <i>not</i></li> <li>Discover how momentum can beat the market</li> <li>Take momentum beyond asset allocation into stock selection</li> <li>Access the tools that ease DIY implementation</li> </ul> <p>The large Wall Street hedge funds tend to portray themselves as the sophisticated elite, but momentum investing allows you to 'borrow' one of their top strategies to enrich your own portfolio. <i>Quantitative Momentum</i> is the individual investor's guide to boosting market success with a robust momentum strategy.</p></p><p><p>On the surface, value investors seem to have a polar opposite mindset from momentum investors. Value investors generally buy cheap out-of-favor stocks, while momentum investors buy stocks with strong price trends. But the behavioral biases and career concerns that drive expected excess returns for value investors are the key mechanisms also driving the long-term sustainability of momentum. <i>Quantitative Momentum</i> fully explores exactly how and why systematic momentum investing is a powerful strategy, arguing that momentum investing is potentially more potent than value investing.</p> <p>A long-held secret of Wall Street hedge funds, and other investors savvy about behavioral finance, is that momentum investing was never a "growth" strategy--it is, and always has been, a historically successful practice that investors should buy winners, regardless of their growth prospects. With the rigor and educational sensibilities author Wesley Gray used to deliver <i>Quantitative Value, </i> the bible on systematic value investing, <i>Quantitative Momentum </i>is a first-of-its-kind guidebook for the individual investor looking to build a stock-picking platform based on momentum. Specifically, the momentum approach identified is ideal for balancing a deep value portfolio and helps to shorten the multi-year relative underperformance of both stand-alone strategies. See how it works for yourself on an accompanying website featuring tools for finding the momentum stocks described inside, additional research, and access to a dynamic community that follows advances in quantitative investing. Written to empower investors through education, this practical system unfolds in micro-lessons of narrative advice and guidance reinforced by illustrative examples that fully prepare you to do the following: </p><ul><li>Understand how and why momentum strategies may or may not work in the future</li> <li>Form a portfolio of stocks based on evidence-based momentum stock- selection signals</li> <li>Tactically deploy a momentum stock portfolio in the context of a broader investment portfolio</li></ul> <p>Look no further than <i>Quantitative Momentum</i> to inject PhD-level research and sophistication into your portfolio.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>Quantitative Momentum</i></b></p> <p>"In our own research, we have found that the predictive price return momentum pattern persists backward in time for hundreds of years in equities and for extended out-of-sample settings for other classes of assets.

The use of R in the classroom is increasing each year, and the need for user-friendly books to help integrate methodological training with this powerful statistical language has reached a critical stage. Professor Pollock&#x2019;s book fills this gap superbly. It takes the student from the elements of installing R on their own computer or laptop through the use of R to solve both simple and complex problems in social and political analysis.

The Messer was a single-edged, one-handed utility sword peculiar to central Europe, but Leck�chner&#39;s techniques apply to cut-and-thrust swords in general: not only is this treatise the single most substantial work on the use of one-handed swords to survive from this period, but it is the most detailed explanation of the two-handed sword techniques of the German &#34;Liechtenauer&#34; school dating back to the 1300s. Leck�chner&#39;s lavish manuscript consists of over four hundred illustrations with explanatory text, in which the author, a parish priest, rings the changes on bladework, deceits, and grappling, with techniques ranging from life-or-death escapes from an armed assailant to slapstick moves designed to please the crowd in public fencing matches. This translation, complete with all illustrations from the manuscript, makes the treatise accessible for the first time since the author&#39;s untimely death less than a year after its completion left his major work to be lost for generations. An extensive introduction, notes, and glossary analyze and contextualize the work and clarify its technical content. Jeffrey L.

It's time to celebrate <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's latest epic, <i>A Season Beyond a Kiss</i>. This pioneer of the romantic fiction genre renews her grateful readers' acquaintance with old friends, the Birminghams of <i>The Flame and the Flower</i> and <i>The Elusive Flame</i> fame. This time it's Brandon's younger brother Jeffrey and his off-again, on-again marriage to beautiful English import Raelynn that captivates audiences. Circumstances--and a murderous villain--have conspired to separate newlyweds Jeff and Raelynn. Raelynn has been broadsided by the accusation that Jeff has impregnated a young serving girl and refused to acknowledge his child. Jeff, of course, vehemently denies the accusation, but Raelynn is unsure she can trust her handsome husband. Just when the young lovers manage to mend their quarrel, a pregnant Raelynn is horrified to discover Jeff standing over the body of the murdered serving girl with the murder weapon in his hand. Throw in a ruthless merchant with designs to possess Raelynn at any cost and a mysterious murderer with a secret worth killing for, and you've got a new classic from veteran author Woodiwiss. In spite of the sometimes convoluted dialogue, fans old and new will be able to overlook the impression that Woodiwiss believes she's being paid by the word and revel in a fresh tale with familiar friends.<i>--Alison Trinkle</i></p>THE FLAME BURNS HOTTER THAN EVER!<p>ROMANCE WAS BORN AND WILL LIVE FOREVER IN THE BREATHTAKING ARTISTRY OF</p><p>KATHLEEN E.

She lectures widely in Israel, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. She lives in Jerusalem.</p>ONE<br><i>Seduced into Eden</i><br><br><b>The Beginning of Desire<br></b><br><i>desire: the lapse in sovereignty</i><br><br>The official history of desire begins here: &#x201c;Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you&#x201d; (Gen. 3:16). With these words, God declares Eve&#x2019;s destiny: a melancholy sketch of the relation of power and desire. Desire is associated with vulnerability. To desire is to lose autonomy; the desired other acquires a sovereignty to which one surrenders in spite of the pain that inevitably ensues. Rashi&#x2019;s classic commentary only deepens the shadow: with feminine desire comes a speechlessness, a failure of language, that in itself gives power to the other.<br><br>Our starting point, then, yields a dark image of desire as feminine, helpless, wordless. Strikingly, however, at the opposite end of the spectrum, God, too, experiences the halting impact of desire. At the outset of the Creation narrative, His power in will and word are absolute. The template is &#x201c;God said, &#x2018;Let there be. . . . And it was so.&#x2019;?&#x201d; Unhesitatingly, word becomes act. However, when God approaches the creation of the human being, the pattern changes. For the first time, there is a preamble, a proposition, a desire: &#x201c;And God said: Let us make Adam in our image and after our form. . . . And God created Man in His image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them&#x201d; (Gen: 1:26&#x2013;27). Whom is God addressing in this preamble? Is it a soliloquy? To whom does the plural, &#x201c;Let us make man in our image,&#x201d; refer? Is this the pluralis maiestatis, the royal &#x201c;we&#x201d;? Or does it refer to other primal beings, angels perhaps, who are mysteriously included in this final project of creation, the human being? Many midrashic accounts would have it so. But then one cannot avoid the impression that God&#x2019;s sovereignty has been compromised. Indeed, Rashi specifically addresses this &#x201c;debasing&#x201d; effect: he quotes the midrash that tells of God&#x2019;s humility in consulting with the angels, whose envy and suspicion of the project He attempts to mollify.<br><br>The risk entailed in such humility is the loss of God&#x2019;s status as sole Creator. He is willing to risk heretical responses in order to model humility to the reader: the powerful person should solicit the opinion of his inferiors. For such a moral purpose, He is willing to go on record as sharing power with others. The midrashic narrative does not take this lightly: at least at this moment of contemplation before creating Man, God is, imaginably, no longer sovereign, no longer One.<br><br>Of course, the breath of scandal is neutralized immediately: &#x201c;And He [singular] created Adam.&#x201d; However, for the first time in the triumphant litany of God&#x2019;s creations, there has occurred a lapse, a suspension of sovereignty. It is only with the idea of the human being that God is moved to this cryptic humility.<br><br>It is striking, however, that a parallel moment does occur later, when God decides to create Eve: &#x201c;Let Me make him a helpmate&#x201d; (Gen. 2:18) Here, of course, God speaks in the powerful singular form. But here, too, as with the creation of Adam, God reflects on a future act; He expresses an intention. And, as we shall see, His intention is not, in fact, immediately implemented. In the end, it is Adam&#x2019;s desire for a mate that enables her creation. This desire arises at the end of a chain of events, a &#x201c;plot,&#x201d; that separates God&#x2019;s reflection from its consummation. In these critical moments when God relates to the creation of Adam and of Eve, desire both informs and inhibits divine omnipotence, in the same way as, explicitly, it erodes Eve&#x2019;s autonomy.<br><br><i>in god&#x2019;s image</i><br><br>If we return now to God&#x2019;s project for man, we are confronted by the most eloquent and mystifying of all God&#x2019;s creative words: &#x201c;Let us make man in our image, after our form.&#x201d; This creature is to be, in some essential way, similar to his creator. This resemblance will give him dominion over the earth&#x2019;s resources. Clearly, man is to hold a special relationship to God; in a sense, he is to be the symbol of God&#x2019;s presence on earth. But how is one to understand such a notion of being like God, given that the human being is limited, mortal, and contingent, while God is infinite, eternal, and absolute? One might even say that one of the main needs that man has of God is that He be different, precisely not limited in the ways that man knows himself to be: man requires a God immune to human deficiencies.<br><br>Moreover, to compound the mystery, the enigmatic notion of man resembling God is picked up, strangely, by the serpent, in his insidious suggestion to Eve that the Tree of Knowledge yields precisely such a gift&#x2014;and that God resents man&#x2019;s appropriating this gift: &#x201c;For God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil&#x201d; (Gen. 3:5). Eating of the Tree will make Adam indeed like God. Thus the serpent.<br><br>But God, too, speaks again, at the end of the narrative, of such a resemblance. He is, in fact, moved by this resemblance to expel him from the Garden:<br><br>And the Lord God said: Behold, man has become as one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, what if he should stretch out his hand to take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever. . . . So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden . . . (Gen. 3:22&#x2013;23).<br><br>It seems that the serpent was right: eating of the Tree of Knowledge has indeed made man like God. Even the recurrence of the plural, &#x201c;one of Us,&#x201d; serves to obscure God&#x2019;s unique sovereignty. Only man&#x2019;s mortality still differentiates him; he must therefore be expelled, before his resemblance to God becomes total. How does this enigmatic scenario engage with God&#x2019;s original project of &#x201c;man in our image&#x201d;? Is a specific resemblance implied in the divine project? And is man&#x2019;s eventual likeness to God a fulfillment or a subversion of that project?<br><br><i>adam in the human image?</i><br><br>At this point I would like to modulate to a different set of questions: Does Adam resemble us? Is Adam recognizably human? Do we acknowledge ourselves in the figure portrayed in the Torah? And if Adam does not resemble us, does Adam&#x2019;s resemblance to God become irrelevant to human identity as we know it?<br><br>I want to suggest that, indeed, in his created condition, Adam is not identical with ourselves. Vast areas of the human are alien to him. My project will be to explore some implications of this difference and of the role that the Tree of Knowledge plays in transforming Adam into a recognizable human being.<br><br>Essential to this difference is the history of desire. According to a provocative Hasidic reading, it is the postlapsarian man and woman who, paradoxically, become godlike. My project will involve further questions about time and language, the unconscious, and the decentered self, as constitutive of the human and&#x2014;in a specific sense&#x2014;of God.<br><br>In the obvious sense, Adam is sui generis: his origin and mode of entry into the world are unlike ours. God&#x2019;s hands shape him out of earth; God&#x2019;s breath breathes him to life. Body and soul, substance and energy are generated directly by God.<br><br>The early history of Adam is sparse. But one essential detail, obscured in the text, is detected by the midrash. Adam did not originate in the Garden of Eden. &#x201c;And the Lord God took the man and set him down in the Garden of Eden&#x201d; (Gen. 2:15). Wherever he was first created, it was not in Eden. He is transplanted by God, moved out of his place, to another place.<br><br><i>seduced into eden</i><br><br>The midrash addresses the word Va-yikach, &#x201c;God took.&#x201d; In Rashi&#x2019;s version: &#x201c;He took [captivated] him with beautiful words and seduced him to enter the Garden.&#x201d; Rashi often makes a similar comment when the word &#x201c;take&#x201d; has a human object, as though taking by force is inappropriate in moving a human being from one place to another. His comment implies that the only way to move a human being is by language, &#x201c;beautiful words.&#x201d;<br><br>Here, however, the word pitahu, &#x201c;He seduced him,&#x201d; is disturbing. This midrashic translation makes seduction the first human experience&#x2014;seduction by God. Seduction, too, is constitutive of man&#x2019; s entry into language. The word carries connotations of persuasion but also of deception, of heady promises about which it might be wise to be suspicious. In the book of Proverbs, the peti is a simpleton, easily seduced, the opposite of the valued hakham, the wise one. The obvious association is with sexuality, with a manipulation of innocence, in which private purposes are masked in captivating but treacherous language. Why would the midrash, and Rashi in his turn, use this word, which, in both Hebrew and English, has such uneasy associations?<br><br>We will return to this question of seduction, which, I will suggest, is the essential repressed moment of the narrative. For now, one wonders why Adam needed to be seduced at all. To enter the Garden of Eden would seem to be a prospect of delight, rather than one about which to have reservations. But God apparently has to persuade Adam with glowing rhetoric to make the move. One midrash has Adam anticipate the risks and challenges of Eden: there he will confront and fail a test. In response, God entices him by promising that a future descendant, Abraham, will retroactively redeem the whole apparently woeful narrative. Subtly, the midrash suggests a cautious self-awareness in Adam that God must overcome by non- rational means. In the end, Adam must yield to God&#x2019;s will.<br><br>By using the notion of seduction, however, the midrash implies a kind of &#x201c;unfairness&#x201d; about God&#x2019;s influence, which overwhelms Adam&#x2019;s judgment. To suggest this is to raise the question of God&#x2019; s credibility. While, ultimately, His plot turns out for human benefit, the midrash conveys a strange indirection in His methods: blandishments that, in the short term, at least, it might be canny to resist.<br><br>Seduction creates an awareness of previously unsuspected desire: here, God awakens in Adam a sense of unfathomed depths of self. One who has been seduced, even by God, is no longer entirely innocent, immaculate. A message has been registered, if not fully comprehended.<br><br>Midrashic uses of the idiom of seduction abound. God seduces/persuades Moses for seven days at the Burning Bush to accept the mission of liberating the Israelites; Sarah seduces/persuades Hagar to become Abraham&#x2019;s concubine(her persuasive words are, &#x201c;Ashrayikh&#x2014;Happy are you to merit union with such a holy body!&#x201d;); God instructs Moses to seduce/persuade Aaron to ascend the mountain to his death (&#x201c;Happy are you to see your crown given to your son&#x201d;). At such moments, the unacceptable is imagined as, potentially, desirable; reality is reshaped by language. In most of these cases, the key word in the Torah is &#x201c;take,&#x201d; translated as &#x201c;captivate, beguile, seduce.&#x201d; God, who sometimes seduces in this way, is at other times seduced: Isaac&#x2019;s prayer for Rebecca to bear children is &#x201c;complied with&#x201d; (nitpateh lo) by God.<br><br>Seducing and being seduced, then, are not always illegitimate; nevertheless, they retain an overtone of embarrassment. After all, if one is to respond to the blandishments of the other, one must yield up an important kind of control. This could be a foolish act, or a generous one. Is this surrender, or submission? To assume the role of seducer: Is this insidious domination, or imaginative enlivening of the other, arousing him to possibilities inherent in what is not fully grasped? Is this faith, or gullibility?<br><br><i>alien sexuality?</i><br><br>Adam, then, has different origins from those we recognize as our own. He is seduced into Eden&#x2014;and then driven out of it. Another dimension of his difference is indicated in the verse that precedes the serpent&#x2019;s seduction: &#x201c;And the two of them were naked and unashamed&#x201d; (Gen. 2:25). It is clear that this comment on the first couple, immediately following on the words &#x201c;and they shall be one flesh&#x201d; (2:24), communicates a sense of wonder about an unself- conscious sexuality assumed to be alien to the reader. Indeed, Rashi comments on the link between this observation and the serpent&#x2019;s plot:<br><br>&#x201c;The serpent was cunning [arum&#x2014;both &#x2018;naked&#x2019; and &#x2018;cunning&#x2019;]&#x201d;: Why does this belong here, in the context of nakedness? It would have been more logical to follow the reference to nakedness with, &#x201c;He made for Adam and his wife coats of skin and He clothed them&#x201d; (Gen. 3:21). But the Torah teaches the serpent&#x2019;s motive for attacking them: he saw them in naked intercourse and he desired her.<br><br>Nakedness thus intimates the unself-conscious sexuality of Adam and Eve, which exposes them to the gaze of the serpent. Perhaps what the serpent desires is precisely this innocent sexuality; he desires her in order to spoil her.<br><br>In any event, between the two moments of nakedness and clothing, the serpent engenders a new Adam and Eve whom we begin to acknowledge as familiars.</p><h2>The Stem Cell Cure: Remake Your Body and Mind</h2><p><p>Renowned regenerative and restorative sports medicine doctor Guarav Goswami, M.D. provides advanced minimally invasive (non-surgical) treatments to help his patients get back to peak performance levels &#x2013; no matter their age.

Asking questions as basic as "Who were the teachers and students and from what segment of Israelite society did they come?" and "How did instructors interest young people in the things they had to say?" Crenshaw explores the institutions and practices of education in ancient Israel. The results are often surprising and more complicated than one would expect.<br><br>Education, for the people who lived in the biblical world, was more than a simple matter of memorizing information and taking tests. It was a search for the hidden plan and presence of God. Knowledge was gained, according to biblical texts such as Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, not only by means of patient observation and listening, but through communication with Wisdom, the feminine incarnation of the Divine. Drawing upon a broad range of ancient sources, Crenshaw examines this religious dimension of education in ancient Israel, demonstrating how the practice of teaching and learning was transformed into the supreme act of worship.</p><p>James L. Crenshaw's <i>Education in Ancient Israel</i>, a book about how knowledge was transmitted from generation to generation in biblical times, may also shed light on some of the more contentious issues in education today. Crenshaw reads biblical books such as Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes, as well as Sumerian and Egyptian texts to find clues about how students learned to read and memorize their lessons in biblical times. He also describes the frightening forms of corporal punishment that sometimes took place when students failed. Crenshaw's central thesis is that in biblical times, "education originated with the desire for order and community." To realize that desire, educators embarked on ambitious programs of "moral formation, the building of character," which was always strengthened by instruction in religious devotion. Crenshaw's project is historical, so his book stays neutral in contemporary education wars. Still, it's interesting to imagine him head-to-head with someone like William Bennett, considering the question of why so many people of faith today have ideas about education that closely resemble the standards of biblical times. --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><h2>Basic Mathematics for College Students with Early Integers</h2><p>In the Sixth Edition of Tussy/Koenig&#39;s BASIC MATHEMATICS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH EARLY INTEGERS, new &#34;Look Alikes&#34; help you compare and contrast problem types to help you understand the correct meaning of the questions and determine the necessary steps to work the problem.

Nicholas Nicastro brings to life one of history's greatest experiments when an ancient Greek named Eratosthenes first accurately determined the distance around the spherical earth. In this fascinating narrative history, Nicastro takes a look at a deceptively simple but stunning achievement made by one man, millennia ago, with only the simplest of materials at his disposal. How was he able to measure the land at a time when distance was more a matter of a shrug and a guess at the time spent on a donkey&#x2019;s back? How could he be so confident in the assumptions that underlay his calculations: that the earth was round and the sun so far away that its rays struck the ground in parallel lines? Was it luck or pure scientific genius? Nicastro brings readers on a trip into a long-vanished world that prefigured modernity in many ways, where neither Eratosthenes' reputation, nor the validity of his method, nor his leadership of the Great Library of Alexandria were enough to convince all his contemporaries about the dimensions of the earth. Eratosthenes' results were debated for centuries until he was ultimately vindicated almost 2000 years later, during the great voyages of exploration. &#x201c;Circumference&#x201d; is a compelling scientific detective story that transports readers back to a time when humans had no idea how big their world was--and the fate of a man who dared to measure the incomprehensible.</p><p>NICHOLAS NICASTRO PhD has taught history, anthropology, and psychology at Cornell University and Hobart-William Smith Colleges.

Though long-distance travel in antiquity was never a trivial undertaking, a summer voyage to Egypt would have been a pleasant journey. Eratosthenes would no doubt have first made inquiries at Athens' port of Piraeus for passage aboard a freighter. In his time, there was no specialized passenger trade spanning the Aegean: a traveler would simply go down to the waterfront, or perhaps the storefront offices of a reputable shipping company, and ask for passage on a vessel heading toward his destination. For obscure places or sailings out of season, he had to make do with passage to someplace near his destination and complete his journey aboard smaller coastal craft or overland. But in the case of the Athens-Alexandria run, he would have had little trouble finding passage; the route in the mid-third century BCE would have been well plied, with frequent direct sailings by shippers making a good profit.Vessels leaving Alexandria were weighted down with the wares of the greatest entrep�t in the Mediterranean world: grain and papyrus from the Egyptian countryside; wine from the vineyards around Lake Mareotis; textiles, glass, goldwork, faience, papyrus, unguents, and perfumes from the city's factories; spices, incense, aromatic woods, and other luxuries from Arabia and points east. Athens herself by the mid-third century had already been supplanted by Rhodes as the leading mercantile democracy in theAegean. Because Athenian bulk exports to Egypt would have been far more limited than her imports, Alexandrian cargo ships would come home far higher in the water than when they set out. Indeed, Athens' most important exports to Ptolemy's kingdom would not have been her signature products, such as wine, honey, and olive oil, or even books for the Great Library, but intellectuals like Eratosthenes himself.Ships of the time were small by modern standards: the only Hellenistic-era merchant vessel known to archaeology, the so-called Kyrenia ship discovered off the north coast of Cyprus in 1967, was a four-man island hopper that measured only forty-seven feet long and fifteen wide. Dwarfing that would have been the big grain ships that plied the Egypt-Italy route in Roman times, such as the 180-foot-long, 44-foot-wide <i>Isis</i> described by Lucian of Samosata in the second century CE. But such leviathans appeared only late in antiquity, and were exceptional. Most likely Eratosthenes would have booked passage on something far more modest.The right price bought space on deck to lay a bedroll or perhaps pitch a small tent. Cabins, which were few, expensive, and undoubtedly cramped, were more suited to the wives and daughters of the wealthy, who needed privacy away from the crew and the other passengers, almost all of whom were male. (This, notwithstanding the effect on milady's stomach: an ancient merchantman with its round bottom and small sails--the Kyrenia ship had only about sixty-four square meters of canvas--would have pitched and rolled terribly. This effect would have seemed far worse to those confined onboard in a tiny cubicle.)To a man in his prime such as Eratosthenes, there would have been no reason to avoid spending his time under the open sky. Moderns can hardly imagine the contrast of breathing clean sea air after sampling the conditions in a typical ancient Greek city, with no internal plumbing, few allowances for public sanitation, and animals and theirwaste everywhere. Narrow streets cut city dwellers off from sky and sun; insecurity at night kept them indoors, away from the stars.But on a quiet sea, with lungs and nostrils unburdened, no responsibilities, and much time on his hands, the traveler with a philosophic bent could find his imagination enlarged. Presented with the night sky, Eratosthenes might have contemplated the cosmological speculations of Thales, Anaximander, Leucippus, and the Pythagoreans. He might have considered the popular theory that the Milky Way, which glowed so brightly at sea, was the remnant of a path through the sky abandoned by the sun. Or he might simply have been impressed with how little was truly known about what he saw above him.Passage to Africa during the fair-sailing season--roughly, May to October--would have put the seasonal winds behind the ship's sails. After a few days afloat, a different sort of star would have appeared near the southern horizon: a steady gleam that would shine day and night, never setting but rising subtly as the vessel neared shore. At the sight of it most of those aboard would have begun their obeisances to the gods who had secured their safe passage. The beacon of the Lighthouse of Alexandria was, after all, the passengers' first direct glimpse of their destination.TOWER OF SIGNIFICANCE<i>There is an island washed by the open sea lying off the Nile mouth--seamen call it Pharos-- distant a day's sail in a clean hull with a brisk land breeze behind. It has a harbor, a sheltered bay, where shipmasters take on dark water for the outward voyage.</i>&nbsp;<br>--<i>The Odyssey</i>, book IVThe Great Lighthouse (in Greek, Pharos) was for centuries one of the tallest human-made structures on earth. Based on contemporary illustrations and descriptions of its remains, historians know that it was sited on a small natural island (also called Pharos) that was connected to the mainland by a mole (breakwater causeway) that, in turn, separated the east and west harbors of the city (see figure 1). Built of white limestone and pink Aswan granite, the Pharos had a tripartite structure based on a vaguely Pythagorean geometric theme, with a square-sided base, octagonal middle, and circular upper stage. At its very top was mounted a lantern that included a mirror for reflecting sunlight during the day, and for an oil-fed fire at night. At a height of 384 feet, its beacon would theoretically have been visible some thirty miles out to sea--more than a day's sail away. If the Pharos had somehow been plucked off the North African shore and placed on Lake Michigan, it would have topped the Chicago skyline until the construction of the Wrigley Building in 1922.Dedicated in the early third century at a cost of eight hundred talents, the Lighthouse was one of the first monumental structures completed after the city's founding. Its manifest purpose was to compensate for the lack of landmarks for navigating the northwest Egyptian coast, though its utility as a lookout (and, if legend is to be believed, for burning ships at a distance with its great mirror) would have been a useful bonus. As such it represented an innovation: while towers had been built elsewhere, and human-made landmarks, such as the gleaming bronze helmet of Athena Promachos on the Athenian Acropolis, had incidental uses in navigation, the Pharos was probably the first structure expressly designed for that purpose. There was nothing in mainland Greece to compare to it.It therefore comes as something of a surprise that the first known catalog of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, that ofAntipator of Sidon (c. second century BCE), did not include the Pharos. Instead, Antipater preferred to list the Walls of Babylon. It wasn't until the first century CE that the practically minded Romans, specifically Pliny the Elder, included the Lighthouse among the canonical seven (along with the Pyramids of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus). The Lighthouse was so well constructed, however, that it was among the last Wonders to vanish: Arab travelers describe at least part of the tower surviving well into the medieval period. The rest of the Pharos finally succumbed to earthquakes in the early fourteenth century CE. Underwater surveys of the area northeast of the island clearly show remnants of the tower toppled in that direction, with more than two thousand of its blocks littering the harbor bed.Yet, like many landmark structures in history, the Lighthouse towered as much in symbol as in physical height. It was a practical expression of the self-aggrandizing impulse that inspired other megastructures in the new Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the renovated Temple of Apollo at Didyma, or the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Like the buildup of super-tall skyscrapers along the Asian rim in our own time, architectural gigantism followed the accumulation of sufficient money and political confidence to make such gestures. Sure enough, the Pharos's visibility was fully exploited to advertise the splendor of the Ptolemaic state: much of what we know about its appearance is based on its representation on coins, lamps, and other souvenirs, where it was reproduced as frequently as the Statue of Liberty is today (see figure 2). More to the point, its ingenious design, which anticipated the setback designs of modern masonry skyscrapers by more than twenty centuries, might have represented the first practical fruit of research done at the institution Eratosthenes had come to join--the Museum.The beacon would have had another significant implication to an informed mind like Eratosthenes'. Its visibility from far out at sea, when the rest of the coast appeared to lie below the horizon, was as graphic a demonstration as possible of the curvature of the earth's surface. This would (or should) have ruled out competing models of the planet's shape, such as Thales' disk, Anaximander's flat-topped column, and Leucippus's kettledrum. One of the key assumptions of Eratosthenes' measurement of the earth's circumference--that the planet is spherical--would have been reinforced in his mind even before he set foot on Egyptian soil.INTO THE BIRDCAGE<i>Many are feeding in populous Egypt, scribblers on papyrus, ceaselessly wrangling in the birdcage of the Muses.</i>&nbsp;<br>--TIMON OF PHLIUS (c. 320-230)&nbsp;<br>The final approach to the city would have presented the ship's passengers with a panorama of Greek ingenuity. The city's <i>Greek</i> character deserves emphasis: though Alexandria was located in the enviably rich kingdom of Egypt, and Egypt had been respected for centuries (along with Babylonia) as the font of all ancient wisdom, there never seemed any prospect of constructing a capital that actually <i>looked</i> authentically Egyptian. The ambiguous relationship of the capital to the rest of the country was obvious even to outsiders: the Romans, who knew a thing or two about the geography of power, called it Alexandria ad Aegyptum, or "Alexandria <i>near</i> Egypt," not in it.To be sure, the Ptolemies did commission massive new temples in the ancient style, largely to help the Macedonian rulers ingratiate themselves with their native subjects. But those constructions stood upriver, at such places as Dendera, Edfu, and Philae. The Greeks had also plundered interior sites, such as Heliopolis, for sphinxes, obelisks, columns, and so on, with which to decorate their public spaces. These appear to have been spread about, out of context, like titanic bric-a-brac, in a manner that would have struck the natives as highly irreverent--Egyptianizing instead of Egyptian. (The twin seventy-foot "Cleopatra's Needles"--obelisks--were first installed in Alexandria just after the Ptolemaic period, and subsequently shipped to the West. They are now mounted on the Thames embankment and in Central Park in New York, largely for the same reasons the Ptolemies had for displaying them.)Strabo offers the best surviving description of the city in its heyday. Approaching from the north, Eratosthenes' ship would likely have made for the mouth of the eastern or Great Harbor, which was bound by Pharos Island on the west and on the east by the promontory of Lochias. The pilot would have had to proceed carefully around the rocks that either stuck their heads above the water or lay just below the surface--Strabo makes a point of mentioning the violence of the sea in the vicinity. As the ship entered protected waters and proceeded along one of three channels (nicknamed Steganos, Posideos, and Tauros) to the docks, Eratosthenes would have seen the Lighthouse towering over him on his right, clad in marble and graced with monumental statuary, the trident of the bronze Poseidon (or Zeus or Proteus) at its peak gleaming in the sun.Before him, the city's waterfront would have stretched in a crescent: starting from the east, where the Lochias peninsula (today, sunk below sea level) joins the mainland, he would have seen the royal compound--a sprawling complex of "various dwellings and groves" so sprawling that it "occup[ies] a fourth or even a thirdpart of [the city's] whole extent. For as each of the kings was desirous of adding some embellishment to the places dedicated to the public use, so, besides the buildings already existing, each of them erected a building at his own expense; hence the expression of the poet may be here applied, 'one after the other springs.'" Strabo notes that the buildings of the royal pleasure dome were "all connected with one another and with the harbor, and those also which are beyond it"--a scheme that Fraser likens to the Topkapi palace in Istanbul, but that also suggests the mazelike arrangement that Caesar would find so frustrating in his attempts to barricade himself in the palaces two hundred years later.Below the palaces would have lain the royal anchorage, and beyond that, the small island (since vanished) that in Strabo's time boasted "a palace and a small port" and was known somewhat grandiosely as Anti-Rhodes. Behind, on higher ground, stood a splendid theater, a compulsory feature in any Greek city, and to its west, the Emporion, a complex of docks and customshouses where every ship was inspected. Farther east was the Serapeion, a vast temple complex six hundred feet long and one hundred wide, dedicated to Alexandria's patron deity. Serapis was an amalgam of Apis, the native bull god, and Osiris, the anthropomorphic lord of the dead--an instant "designer god" fashioned by the Ptolemies to give Greeks and Egyptians a deity in common.The inspections at the Emporion had their pecuniary purpose, of course. Much of the state's revenue was derived not from direct taxation, but from duties placed on goods moving in and out of the port. But they had another mission: since the foundation of the Museum, the Ptolemies had a standing policy of confiscating any valuable books that arrived by ship in the town, copying them, and returning the copies to the owner. The originals were retained in a special section of the Great Library called "the ships' collection." In this and other ways the Ptolemies were able, in just a few decades, to amass thelargest collection of books in the Greek world. We can be sure, then, that if Eratosthenes brought any of his own books from Athens, they would have been thoroughly examined by the king's officials.The Great Harbor was deep enough for the biggest ships to come right up to the edge of the street grid. As the passengers waited for the royal inspectors to complete their work, we can imagine that Eratosthenes was close enough to hear the bustle of the merchants' quarter, and to smell the city's fragrant treasures--the half-fruity, half-balsamic complexity of frankincense, cinnamon's sweet bite, the tang of pepper.Cleared at least to proceed into the city, the visitor would soon encounter a spectacle of urban grandeur widely celebrated in its time.

Over the last 60 years, scholars have drawn upon the disciplines of psychology, economics, sociology, and even biology to learn how ordinary people come to understand the complicated business of politics. But much of the path-breaking research in the field of public opinion is published in journals, taking up fairly narrow questions one at a time and often requiring advanced statistical knowledge to understand these findings. As a result, the study of public opinion can seem confusing and incoherent to undergraduates. To engage undergraduate students in this area, a new type of textbook is required. </p> <p>The second edition of <i>New Directions in Public Opinion</i> brings together leading scholars to provide an accessible and coherent overview of the current state of the field of public opinion. Each chapter provides a general overview of topics that are at the cutting edge of study as well as well-established cornerstones of the field. Each contributor has made substantive revisions to their chapters, and three chapters have been added on genetics and biology, immigration, and political extremism and the Tea Party. Suitable for use as a main textbook or in tandem with a lengthier survey, this book comprehensively covers the topics of public opinion research and pushes students further to explore critical topics in contemporary politics.</p></p><p><p><strong>Adam J.

He has received numerous awards for his research.</p><p>"Berinsky has brought together a world-class group of scholars working on cutting edge puzzles in the causes and consequences of public opinion. The book is an excellent resource for students, containing foundational insights about measurement and research design, electoral dynamics, and campaign media strategy. The largest contribution of this volume, however, may be the treasure trove of ideas for future research on the impact of group attitudes and identities in structuring our politics."</p> <p></p> <p>-- Nicholas A.

But what about Canada? One suspects that even most well-educated Americans are woefully ignorant of the key personalities, events, and trends in Canadian history. Hopefully, this excellent anthology devoted to various aspects of Canadian history will help remedy that situation. Each of the six chapters is written by a different and distinguished historian or geographer. Among the topics covered, the examinations of Native American cultures and of Canada's relations with the U.S. are particularly interesting. The illustrations, both black and white and color, are superb complements to the text, and few of them are familiar to Americans. This is a fine general history of a huge, diverse nation with a rich heritage, and it is certainly in our interest to learn more about it. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Why did the Egyptians use a bizarre method of expressing fractions? Why did the Babylonians use an awkward number system based on multiples of 60? Rudman answers such intriguing questions, arguing that some mathematical thinking is universal and timeless. The similarity of the Babylonian and Mayan number systems, two cultures widely separated in time and space, illustrates the argument. He then traces the evolution of number systems from finger counting in hunter-gatherer cultures to pebble counting in herder-farmer cultures of the Nile and Tigris-Euphrates valleys, which defined the number systems that continued to be used even after the invention of writing. With separate chapters devoted to the remarkable Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics of the era from about 3500 to 2000 BCE, when all of the basic arithmetic operations and even quadratic algebra became doable, Rudman concludes his interpretation of the archeological record. Since some of the mathematics formerly credited to the Greeks is now known to be a prior Babylonian invention, Rudman adds a chapter that discusses the math used by Pythagoras, Eratosthenes, and Hippasus, which has Babylonian roots, illustrating the watershed difference in abstraction and rigor that the Greeks introduced. He also suggests that we might improve present-day teaching by taking note of how the Greeks taught math. Complete with sidebars offering recreational math brainteasers, this engrossing discussion of the evolution of mathematics will appeal to both scholars and lay readers with an interest in mathematics and its history.</p><p>Peter S. Rudman (Haifa, Israel) is professor (ret.) of solid-state physics at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and the author of more than 100 articles in physics.Anyone who has ever wondered why an hour is divided into 60 minutes has much to learn from Rudman, student of the ancient mathematics of the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Mayans. Behind the base-60 number system that survives on a clock face, Rudman discerns the fascinating history of how numbers evolved beyond the finger- and stone-counting of hunter-gatherer societies. It all started with the Babylonians, who fit very old body-part measurements into a powerful new arithmetic of squares and square roots. Rudman also probes the physiological logic that equipped the Mayans with base-20 numbers for mapping the heavens, and he scrutinizes the brilliance of Egyptian mathematicians who calculated complex volumes without calculus. Readers can deepen their understanding of ancient feats by working out the numerous "Fun Questions" Rudman has embedded in his text to provide practical experience with key concepts. Such experience leads eventually to the conceptual threshold the Greeks crossed 2,500 years ago when they began developing proofs for their mathematical theories. Even readers casually interested in mathematics will enjoy traveling the road that leads to Pythagoras. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This number was more than the entire Confederate military force in the summer of 1861, and it far exceeded the strength of any army that Lee ever commanded. More than 80,000 Southerners fell in just five battles. At Gettysburg three out of every ten Confederates present were hit; one brigade lost 65 percent of its men and 70 percent of its field officers in a single charge. A North Carolina regiment started the action with some 800 men; only 216 survived unhurt. Another unit lost two-thirds of its men as well as its commander in a brief assault.&#x201d;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did the Confederacy lose so many men? The authors contend that the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war by making costly attacks more often than the Federals. Offensive tactics, which had been used successfully by Americans in the Mexican War, were much less effective in the 1860s because an improved weapon &#x2013; the rifle &#x2013; had given increased strength to defenders. This book describes tactical theory in the 1850s and suggests how each related to Civil War tactics. It also considers the development of tactics in all three arms of the service during the Civil War.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In examining the Civil War the book separates Southern from Northern tactical practice and discusses Confederate military history in the context of Southern social history. Although the Southerners could have offset their numerical disadvantage by remaining on the defensive and forcing the Federals to attack, they failed to do so. The authors argue that the Southerners&#x2019; consistent favoring of offensive warfare was attributable, in large measure, to their Celtic heritage: they fought with the same courageous dash and reckless abandon that had characterized their Celtic forebears since ancient times. The Southerners of the Civil War generation were prisoners of their social and cultural history: they attacked courageously and were killed &#x2013; on battlefields so totally defended by the Federals that &#x201c;not even a chicken could get through.&#x201d;</p><p>This book is a veritable kaleidoscope, showing pictures ranging from the seemingly hyperbolic to those that are clearly representative of the finest scholarship to be found anywhere.<b>Grady McWhiney</b> is professor of history, and director and distinguished senior fellow, Center for the Study of Southern History and Culture, The University of Alabama.&nbsp;<b>Perry D.

While most historians have long described Italians as relatively protective of Jews during this time, <i>The Italian Executioners</i> tells a very different story, recounting in vivid detail the shocking events of a period in which Italians set in motion almost half the arrests that sent their Jewish compatriots to Auschwitz.</p><p>This brief, beautifully written narrative shines a harsh spotlight on those who turned on their Jewish fellow citizens. These collaborators ranged from petty informers to Fascist intellectuals&#x2015;and their motives ran from greed to ideology. Drawing insights from Holocaust and genocide studies and combining a historian&#x2019;s rigor with a novelist&#x2019;s gift for scene-setting, Levis Sullam takes us into Italian cities large and small, from Florence and Venice to Brescia, showing how events played out in each. Re-creating betrayals and arrests, he draws indelible portraits of victims and perpetrators alike.</p><p>Along the way, Levis Sullam dismantles the seductive popular myth of <i>italiani brava gente</i>&#x2015;the &#x201c;good Italians&#x201d; who sheltered their Jewish compatriots from harm. The result is an essential correction to a widespread misconception of the Holocaust in Italy. In collaboration with the Nazis, and with different degrees and forms of involvement, the Italians were guilty of genocide.</p></p><p><b>Simon Levis Sullam</b> is associate professor of modern history at Ca&#x2019; Foscari University of Venice. His previous books include <i>Giuseppe Mazzini and the Origins of Fascism</i>.&#x201c;In this thoroughly researched and authoritative book, Simon Levis Sullam describes the murderous anti-Jewish policy of the Italian state from 1943 to 1945 and the widespread amnesia that followed the war.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Saul Friedl�nder, University of California, Los Angeles</b><br><br>&#x201c;If the myth of Italy as an innocent state and of Italians as &#x201c;good people&#x201d; (<i>brava gente</i>) lives on, it is in part because Simon Levis Sullam&#x2019;s book on the Italian executioners has yet to be absorbed, or accepted, by a country still haunted by the specter of Fascism and intent on burying its awkward past. English-language readers will gratefully welcome, as history and warning, this fine new translation of Levis Sullam&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Kevin Madigan, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This nuanced, fine-grained history provides detailed evidence of how Italians collaborated with the Nazis in the deportation of Jews from Italy. <i>The Italian Executioners</i> makes an important contribution to dismantling the idea of <i>italiani brava gente</i>&#x2015;the &#x2018;good Italians&#x2019; who presumably were less eager to collaborate than their French counterparts. Levis Sullam vividly describes how a whole network of Italians&#x2015;from Fascist officials and police to bus drivers and next-door neighbors&#x2015;participated in the genocide of Jews.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Barbara Spackman, University of California, Berkeley</b><br><br>&#x201c;Combining trenchant writing and scholarly rigor, <i>The Italian Executioners</i> is a brilliant exposure of how Italians were not always the &#x2018;nice people&#x2019; of the <i>brava gente</i> myth. One of the many virtues of Levis Sullam&#x2019;s fine book is its accounts of such places as Venice and Florence, where it is time to accept that there is past darkness to go with all the light.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Richard J.

Written in the 1940s, the chronicles drip with nostalgic atmosphere--shady porches with tinkling pitchers of lemonade, grandfather clocks, chintz-covered sofas. But longing for this comfortable past proves dangerous in every way to Bradbury's characters--the golden-eyed Martians as well as the humans. Starting in the far-flung future of 1999, expedition after expedition leaves Earth to investigate Mars. The Martians guard their mysteries well, but they are decimated by the diseases that arrive with the rockets. Colonists appear, most with ideas no more lofty than starting a hot-dog stand, and with no respect for the culture they've displaced. <p> Bradbury's quiet exploration of a future that looks so much like the past is sprinkled with lighter material. In "The Silent Towns," the last man on Mars hears the phone ring and ends up on a comical blind date. But in most of these stories, Bradbury holds up a mirror to humanity that reflects a shameful treatment of "the other," yielding, time after time, a harvest of loneliness and isolation. Yet the collection ends with hope for renewal, as a colonist family turns away from the demise of the Earth towards a new future on Mars. Bradbury is a master fantasist and <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> are an unforgettable work of art. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>365 Tarot Spreads: Revealing the Magic in Each Day</h2><p><p>A tarot reading is a quest for answers to your greatest questions, deepest desires, and most profound needs.

A prompt bestseller and Pulitzer Prize-winner, <em>The Education of Henry Adams</em> (1918) recounts his own and his country's development from 1838--the year Adams was born--up to 1905, thus incorporating the Civil War, unprecedented capitalist expansion, and the growth of the United States as a world power. Adams considered the nation both a success and a failure, and this paradox was the very impetus that compelled him to set down his <em>Education</em>--in the pages of which he also voiced a deep skepticism about mankind's ability to control the direction of history. Written with immense wit and irony, reassembling the past while glimpsing at the future, this book wholly expresses what Henry James declared the "complex fate" of being an American. Adams's thoroughly documented vision remains one of the most absorbing American autobiographies ever written.</p><p>Many great artists have had at least intermittent doubts about their own abilities. But <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is surely one of the few masterpieces to issue directly from a raging inferiority complex. The author, to be sure, had bigger shoes to fill than most of us. Both his grandfather and great-grandfather were U.S. presidents. His father, a relative underachiever, scraped by as a member of Congress and ambassador to the Court of St. James. But young Henry, born in Boston in 1838, was destined for a walk-on role in his nation's history--and seemed alarmingly aware of the fact from the time he was an adolescent.<p> It gets worse. For the author could neither match his exalted ancestors nor dismiss them as dusty relics--he was an Adams, after all, formed from the same 18th-century clay. "The atmosphere of education in which he lived was colonial," we are told, </p><blockquote>revolutionary, almost Cromwellian, as though he were steeped, from his greatest grandmother's birth, in the odor of political crime. Resistance to something was the law of New England nature; the boy looked out on the world with the instinct of resistance; for numberless generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed, filled with evil forces to be abolished, and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition; the duty was unchanged.</blockquote> Here, as always, Adams tells his story in a third-person voice that can seem almost extraplanetary in its detachment. Yet there's also an undercurrent of melancholy and amusement--and wonder at the specific details of what was already a lost world.<p> Continuing his uphill conquest of the learning curve, Adams attended Harvard, which didn't do much for him. ("The chief wonder of education is that it does not ruin everybody concerned in it, teachers and taught.") Then, after a beer-and-sausage-scented spell as a graduate student in Berlin, he followed his father to Washington, D.C., in 1860. There he might have remained--bogged down in "the same rude colony ... camped in the same forest, with the same unfinished Greek temples for workrooms, and sloughs for roads"--had not the Civil War sent Adams <i>p�re et fils</i> to London. Henry sat on the sidelines throughout the conflict, serving as his father's private secretary and anxiously negotiating the minefields of English society. He then returned home and commenced a long career as a journalist, historian, novelist, and peripheral participant in the political process--a kind of mouthpiece for what remained of the New England conscience.</p><p> He was not, by any measure but his own, a failure. And the proof of the pudding is <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> itself, which remains among the oddest and most enlightening books in American literature. It contains thousands of memorable one-liners about politics, morality, culture, and transatlantic relations: "The American mind exasperated the European as a buzz-saw might exasperate a pine forest." There are astonishing glimpses of the high and mighty: "He saw a long, awkward figure; a plain, ploughed face; a mind, absent in part, and in part evidently worried by white kid gloves; features that expressed neither self-satisfaction nor any other familiar Americanism..." (That would be Abraham Lincoln; the "melancholy function" his Inaugural Ball.) But most of all, Adams's book is a brilliant account of how his own sensibility came to be. A literary landmark from the moment it first appeared, the <i>Autobiography</i> confers upon its author precisely that prize he felt had always eluded him: success. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>'I cannot remember when I was not fascinated by Henry Adams, ' said Gore Vidal. 'He was remarkably prescient about the coming horrors.' <br>His political ideals shaped by two presidential ancestors--great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams--Henry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to the First World War. <br>Printed privately in 1907 and published to wide acclaim shortly after the author&amp;'s death in 1918, The Education of Henry Adams is a brilliant, idiosyncratic blend of autobiography and history that charts the great transformation in American life during the so-called Gilded Age. <br>With an introduction by renowned historian Edmund Morris.</p><h2>The Child With Special Needs: Encouraging Intellectual and Emotional Growth (A Merloyd Lawrence Book)</h2><p>Stanley Greenspan, internationally known for his work with infants, young children, and their families, and his colleague, nationally recognized child psychologist Serena Wieder, have for the first time integrated their award-winning research and clinical experience into a definitive guide to raising children with special needs. In this essential work they lay out a complete, step-by-step approach for parents, educators, and others who work with developmental problems. Covering all kinds of disabilities including autism, PPD, language and speech problems, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, and ADD the authors offer a new understanding of the nature of these challenges and also specific ways of helping children extend their intellectual and emotional potential.The authors first show how to move beyond labels to observe the unique profile strengths and problems of the individual child. Next, they demonstrate the techniques necessary to help the child not only reach key milestones but also develop new emotional and intellectual capacities. Greenspan's well-known &#x201d;floortime&#x201d; approach enables parents, as well as clinicians, to use seemingly playful interactions that help children actually move up the development ladder and often master creative and abstract thinking formerly thought beyond their reach. Including vivid case histories, the book also offers deep and compassionate understanding of the stresses and rewards involved in raising a child with special needs.whose amazing work with autistic and other special needs children is nationally known, and his colleague, child psychologist Serena Wieder, have integrated a lifetime of research and clinical practice into a single, comprehensive guide for parents.

One of the most intense debates in understanding the development of the human mind is whether cognitive ability is based in genetics or developed through learning experiences.

His radical affirmation of the revealed truth of Christianity changed the course of Christian theology in the twentieth century and is a source of inspiration for countless believers. Pope Pius XII declared that there had been nothing like Karl Barth's later thought since Thomas Aquinas. <em>God Here and Now</em> offers a succinct and accessible overview of that thought. In it, Barth outlines his position on the fundamental tenets of Christian belief, from the decision of faith to the authority of the Bible, and from the interpretation of grace to the significance of Jesus Christ. In this way Barth challenges each and every reader to discover what it means to encounter God, here and now.</p><p>Karl Barth (1886-1968). Protestant theologian, born in Basel, who has been described as &#39;the Einstein of twentieth-century theology.&#39;<strong>'Karl Barth was a man of his time. Yet he was also a genius, able to see a little further than many and to offer new insights into the ways of God and mankind.'</strong> - <em>Professor Colin Gunton, The Times</em><br><br><strong>'With a startling suddenness [Barth's] message has transformed the whole outlook of Protestant theology on the continent.'</strong> - <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><br><br><strong>'This is a beautifully produced reissue of a collection of essays.'</strong> - <em>Reviews in Religion and Theology</em><br><br><strong>'This welcome reissue in the Routledge Classics series...introduces the first-time reader to aspects of his mature thought in an accessible way...</strong><em>God Here and Now</em><strong> is a superb introduction to Barth at his most compelling and most frustrating.'</strong> - <em>Epworth Review</em></p><h2>Evelina: or the History of a Young Lady&#39;s Entrance into the World (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Published anonymously in 1778, here is a story of virtue rewarded, much in the style of Richardson&#39;s Pamela. Pursued and offended by cads and used by boorish relatives, Evelina finds redemption close at hand in the person of Lord Orville, who leads the heroine from chaste maidenhood to virtuous marriage. Rogers authored a biography of Fanny Burney and is the editor of The Meridian Anthology of Early Women Writers.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literatureA work by turns hilarious and grim, Evelina tells the story of a young woman's education in the ways of the world, vividly rendering life in eighteenth-century England. Raised by a pastor after her mother died and her father abandoned her, Evelina leaves the seclusion of the country for her first season out, encounters all manner of people&#x2013;from prospective husbands to rakes to vulgar relatives&#x2013;and endures all manner of trials before she achieves her final triumph.<p>"Before <b>Evelina</b>," W.

At the same time, his creative work has stretched the boundaries of the very media he employs. Though his pieces have allowed viewers to encounter the traditions of landscape and self-portraiture, the limits of representation and the possibilities for animated drawing, and the labor of art, no guide to understanding the full scope of his art has been available until now.<br><br> For five days, Kentridge sat with Rosalind C. Morris to talk about his work. The result&#x2014;<i>That Which Is Not Drawn</i>&#x2014;is a wide-ranging conversation and deep investigation into the artist&#x2019;s techniques and into the psychic and philosophical underpinnings of his body of work. In these pages, Kentridge explains the key concerns of his art, including the virtues of bastardy, the ethics of provisionality, the nature of translation and the activity of the viewer. And together, Kentridge and Morris trace the migration of images across his works and consider the possibilities for a revolutionary art that remains committed to its own transformation.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the thing about a conversation,&#x201d; Kentridge reflects. &#x201c;The activity and the performance, whether it&#x2019;s the performance of drawing or the performance of speech and conversation, is also the engine for new thoughts to happen. It&#x2019;s not just a report of something you know.&#x201d; And here, in this engaging dialogue, we at last have a guide to the continually exciting, continually changing work of one of our greatest living artists.</p><p><b>William Kentridge</b> is one of most prominent contemporary artists in the world, best known for his animated films based on charcoal drawings and his artistic work with books. His work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Opera and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Louvre in Paris, La Scala in Milan, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, among others. <b>Rosalind C.

Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures, the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces, but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math, Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water, for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes), he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by, the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material, from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end, is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all, Hawking is famous for his "we would know the mind of God" remark, which ends the final lecture herein. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Audio version delivered by Stephen W. Hawking using a voice synthesizer machine.</p><h2>The American Black Chamber (Bluejacket Books)</h2><p>During the 1920s Herbert O. Yardley was chief of the first peacetime cryptanalytic organization in the United States, the ancestor of today&#39;s National Security Agency. Funded by the U.S. Army and the Department of State and working out of New York, his small and highly secret unit succeeded in breaking the diplomatic codes of several nations, including Japan. The decrypts played a critical role in U.S. diplomacy. Despite its extraordinary successes, the Black Chamber, as it came to known, was disbanded in 1929. President Hoover&#39;s new Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson refused to continue its funding with the now-famous comment, &#34;Gentlemen do not read other people&#39;s mail.&#34; In 1931 a disappointed Yardley caused a sensation when he published this book and revealed to the world exactly what his agency had done with the secret and illegal cooperation of nearly the entire American cable industry. These revelations and Yardley&#39;s right to publish them set into motion a conflict that continues to this day: the right to freedom of expression versus national security. In addition to offering an expos� on post-World War I cryptology, the book is filled with exciting stories and personalities.</p><p>Herbert O. Yardley, one of the greatest authorities on secret codes and ciphers in the 1920s, was inducted into the NSA Hall of Honor posthumously in 1999. He is also the author of <i>The Chinese Black Chamber</i>.</p><h2>Circumcision: A History Of The World&#39;s Most Controversial Surgery</h2><p>How has a medical practice that carries substantial risk to the patient and offers very little actual benefit become so widely accepted by parents and fiercely advocated by the medical community? Historian of medicine David Gollaher tells the strange history of medicine&#39;s oldest enigma and most persistent ritual in Circumcision. From the extraordinarily painful initiation rite of the ancient Egyptians, through the Hebrew purification ritual, through circumcision&#39;s use by the rising medical community in the nineteenth century as prevention for ailments ranging from bedwetting to paralysis, the great mystery has been the persistence of the practice through vastly different social contexts.</p><p>More than a million infant boys are circumcised every year in America, the highest occurrence of this procedure in the world. Why? Out of sheer cultural habit, concludes David Gollaher in his groundbreaking study, <i>Circumcision</i>. The tremendous momentum behind Gollaher's account is generated by one simple question: what is known about this most common of procedures? Alarmingly, precious little. Gollaher remedies that problem by tracing the historical roots of circumcision as a rite of passage into manhood in various ancient cultures before bringing the reader to 19th-century America, when circumcision rates skyrocketed through endorsements by the nascent American medical profession, which credited circumcision with exaggerated health benefits. Circumcision would eventually turn into a mark of class distinction, and the surgery would become entrenched in modern medical practices, despite scant study of its benefits, dangers, or side effects. Gollaher is to be commended for maintaining an even perspective on a practice that is sure to become increasingly controversial; he allows the research itself to fascinate and illuminate. As expected, there are many unsettling graphic descriptions in this book, but its most horrifying revelation is its most casual: the incontrovertible fact that circumcision remains the least understood--yet most widely practiced--surgery in the United States. <i>--Sumi Hahn Almquist</i><b>Dr. Gollaher</b> is President and CEO of the California Healthcare Institute and the author of Voice for the Mad: The Life of Dorothea Dix.

But his profound influence on other photographers, most famously on Diane Arbus, derives not only from his sensational subject matter and his use of the blinding, close-up flash, but also from his eagerness to photograph the city at all hours, at all levels: coffee shops at three in the morning, hot summer evenings in the tenements, debutante balls, parties in the street, lovers on park benches, the destitute and the lonely. No other photographer has better revealed the non-stop spectacle of life in New York City.Weegee's first book, <i>Naked City</i> (1945), was a runaway success and made him a celebrity who suddenly had assignments from <i>Life</i> and <i>Vogue.</i> By the publication of his second book, <i>Weegee's People</i> (1946), he had cut the wires to his police radio and had begun to photograph the furred and bejeweled <i>grandes dames </i> at the Metropolitan Opera as well as his beloved street people. <i>Naked Hollywood</i> (1953) and <i>Weegee by Weegee</i> (1961) feature portraits of Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol, John F. Kennedy, Nikita Khruschev, and Liberace&#x2014;many of them viewed through the distorted lens of his Weegee-scope.Regarded as some of the most powerful images of twentieth-century photography, Weegee's work now resides in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>&#34;If it bleeds, it leads&#34; -- the cynical battle cry of today&#39;s tabloids -- might easily have been the motto of Arthur Fellig, the freelance photojournalist better known as Weegee, who cruised the streets of 1940s New York in the wee hours of the morning in search of the sensational. His pictures of children sleeping on fire escapes, blood-splattered corpses on sidewalks and amorous couples on the beach -- as seen in this reprint of his first book -- reveal that Weegee, unlike his latter day counterparts, had heart and soul. He also had a cockeyed sense of humor, as evidenced by his captions and camera tips.Weegee&#39;s First book, &#39;Naked City&#39; (1953), was a runaway success and made him a celebrity who suddenly had assignments from Life and Vogue.

In the tradition of Schr�dinger's classic <em>What Is Life?</em>, Kauffman's <em>Investigations</em> is a tour-de-force exploration of the very essence of life itself, with conclusions that radically undermine the scientific approaches on which modern science rests--the approaches of Newton, Boltzman, Bohr, and Einstein.<br> Building on his pivotal ideas about order and evolution in complex life systems, Kauffman finds that classical science does not take into account that physical systems--such as people in a biosphere--effect their dynamic environments in addition to being affected by them. These systems act on their own behalf as autonomous agents, but what defines them as such? In other words, what is life? Kauffman supplies a novel answer that goes beyond traditional scientific thinking by defining and explaining autonomous agents and work in the contexts of thermodynamics and of information theory. Much of <em>Investigations</em> unpacks the progressively surprising implications of his definition. Significantly, he sets the stages for a technological revolution in the coming decades. Scientists and engineers may soon seek to create autonomous agents--both organic and mechanical--that can not only construct things and work, but also reproduce themselves! Kauffman also lays out a foundation for a new concept of organization, and explores the requirements for the emergence of a general biology that will transcend terrestrial biology to seek laws governing biospheres anywhere in the cosmos. Moreover, he presents four candidate laws to explain how autonomous agents co-create their biosphere and the startling idea of a "co-creating" cosmos.<br> A showcase of Kauffman's most fundamental and significant ideas, <em>Investigations</em> presents a new way of thinking about the fundamentals of general biology that will change the way we understand life itself--on this planet and anywhere else in the cosmos.</p><p>How can you tell when a scientific theory is revolutionary?<p> As a rule, when a distinguished scientist says he's come up with a fourth law of thermodynamics, he's wrong. Stuart Kauffman may be the exception.</p><p> The three laws of thermodynamics have been summarized as: You can't win, You can't break even, and You can't get out of the game. Kauffman's candidate for fourth law is: But the game keeps getting more complicated, and there are always more different ways to play.</p><p> One of Kauffman's key concepts is that of the <i>adjacent possible</i>. Imagine a set of things that exist in a particular system (such as a group of reacting chemicals, or an ecological community, or the kinds of toys available in a capitalist economy). The adjacent possible is the set of things that are only one step away from actual existence. Like potential energy in physics, the adjacent possible is a metaphysical idea with real utility.</p><p> You can think of "normal science" (as described by Thomas Kuhn in <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>) as proceeding step by step into the adjacent possible. Most self-styled revolutionary scientific treatises are really crackpottery. They don't stop in the adjacent possible; they go wandering across the landscape and over the speculative horizon. <i>Investigations</i> may be the real thing. Kauffman is pushing into the adjacent possible at many points, from biology, chemistry, thermodynamics, and economics. As he says, "whatever <i>Investigations</i> is--useful, as I hope, or foolish--it is not normal science." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><br><strong>Stuart Kauffman</strong>, winner of the MacArthur "genius" award, is a founding member of the Santa Fe Institute, the leading center for the emerging sciences of complexity.

Thompson</b></p> <br> <p><b>According to numerous reports, almost half of the new teachers who will begin teaching this year will change professions within five years. What makes the first years of a teacher's career so challenging?</b></p> <p>Education is a complex profession involving extremely high stakes for everyone concerned. Even with excellent training, new teachers often find the reality of managing a classroom overwhelming. I began writing advice for new teachers after watching a first-year teacher struggle with a photocopier. I realized that something as simple as making handouts had the potential to ruin a teacher's day. In The First-Year Teacher's Survival Guide, I try to offer practical solutions to the daily problems that today's teachers have to manage. I want the advice that I offer to be realistic, sensible, and, most of all, useful.</p> <p><b>If the first years of a career in education are so difficult, why would anyone choose to teach?</b></p> <p>The first-year teachers that I work with are remarkable people--professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated. Perhaps the most significant characteristic that I have observed in beginning teachers is an idealistic sense of purpose. More than ever before, I see hard-working novice teachers who are committed to the success of every one of their students. These new teachers inspire all of us with their belief that they can change the world one classroom at a time.</p> <p><b>You are a practicing classroom teacher. How have your experiences as an educator shaped your beliefs about the needs of new teachers?</b></p> <p>I'm proud to be a classroom teacher. Working with students every day allows me to have firsthand insights into the issues that affect education professionals in twenty-first century schools. Like many other veteran educators, though, I had to learn much of what I know about teaching by trial and error. This is the book that I needed as a first-year teacher. I remember all too well how awful it felt when I didn't know what to do when things went wrong. Worst of all, I had no idea where to look for the answers that I needed. I have tried to fill The First-Year Teacher's Survival Guide with practical information that will give novice teachers the self-assurance they need to be successful.</p> <p><b>Discipline problems are often cited as a leading cause of stress for educators. How does this book help teachers with potential discipline issues?</b></p> <p>Discipline problems can have a devastating impact on students and teachers alike. No matter how carefully planned a lesson may be, if students are disruptive, they just can't learn. Learning how to manage discipline issues is crucial to a teacher's peace of mind. I have devoted whole sections to preventing problem behavior and dealing with discipline challenges in the classroom, as well as a &#x201c;troubleshooting guide&#x201d; for the 25 most common classroom problems. In addition, two sections focus on building strong relationships with students and helping students relate well to each other. Finally, there is a section on how to motivate students to be successful. Directly and indirectly, suggestions for coping with discipline issues permeate almost every page of the book.</p> <p><b>The First-Year Teacher's Survival Guide is a big book. Were you worried that first-year teachers would be discouraged at how much they have to learn?</b></p> <p>It is a big book. However, education is a very big undertaking. The First-Year Teacher's Survival Guide is not meant to be read in sequence from beginning to end. Instead, the book is divided into seventeen smaller sections so that teachers can choose the topics that they need to review at any given moment. There's a detailed table of contents and an even more detailed index so that it's easy to find helpful solutions, ideas, and strategies. I love it when I meet readers who show me their dog-eared copies filled with sticky notes and highlighted passages. Those teachers have personalized the material so that it is meaningful and helpful. I hope all readers of the book do that.</p> <p><b>If you had only one piece of advice for first-year teachers, what would it be?</b></p> <p>Be proactive! Transform challenges into opportunities. Countless studies indicate that teachers are the most significant factor in any student's schooling.

Paprocki has a message for teens and young adults: athletics and fitness provide daily ways to connect with God. Bishop Paprocki weaves his unique personal story with eight athletic topics and connects them with a path to wholeness.<p><i>Holy Goals for Body and Soul</i> links lessons from the world of sports and fitness--especially the experiences of a Catholic bishop who plays ice hockey--with concrete ways to live a holy life. In Bishop Paprocki's view, everyone is called to holiness, which can be encountered anywhere: "I encounter holiness while training for a marathon. I encounter holiness during a workout at the health club." He explores eight sports-related topics to help the reader navigate a life of holiness: <br><br>1. Fear<br>2. Frustration<br>3. Failure<br>4. Fortitude<br>5. Faith.<br>6. Friendship<br>7. Family<br>8. Fun</p></p><p>Bishop Thomas John Paprocki is a native of Chicago's south side and presides over the Catholic Diocese of Springfield, Illinois. Bishop Paprocki has been playing hockey since the 1960s, often practicing in the basement of his father's pharmacy store with his six brothers; he currently plays goalie in a masters' hockey league. Bishop Paprocki has played goalie in practices with the Chicago Blackhawks and Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League. He also runs marathons; his current total is eighteen. Among his many Church appointments, Bishop Paprocki is the episcopal advisor for Catholic Athletes for Christ<p>Joe Paprocki, younger brother of Bishop Thomas John Paprocki, has been active in pastoral ministry for over thirty years.

He insightfully and inspirationally explains why God should be central to all aspects of our life, including sports. His faith-filled witness and stories from the ice and marathon course provide a modern day application of St. Paul's many scriptural exhortations to apply the lessons of sports to the spiritual life. This work is a valuable contribution to the emerging and evolving dialogue regarding the intersection of sports and faith. Specifically, it reminds us that sports, properly understood, requires the interaction of the body, mind, and soul." --<b>Ray McKenna</b>, President, Catholic Athletes for Christ</p><p><br>"<i>Holy Goals for Body and Soul</i> by Bishop Paprocki is a remarkable story centered on his lifetime walk through sports and his correlation of sports and spirituality. As a young boy, Bishop Paprocki played ice hockey, and even today--as Bishop of Springfield-- has stepped into the nets as goalie, notably with the Chicago Blackhawks. In this remarkable book, he outlines eight steps from his own encounters on and off the ice that can help us be better athletes, better family members, better Catholics -- better 'team players.' A must for every athlete and every athletic administrator's bookshelf, Bishop Paprocki's book brings us with him into the struggle 'inside the net' where we can examine our own athletic experiences and encounter, through his wisdom and guidance, holiness." --<b>Susan Saint Sing</b>, Author of <i>Spirituality of Sport</i></p><p><br>"<i>Holy Goals for Body and Soul</i> offers practical strategies for building a bridge between sports and faith. Sometimes sports teach the wrong lessons. When sports are done with an intentional connection to faith, our young people can discover and develop Christian virtues that thrive on the field and in their daily lives. Winning becomes living as a faithful disciple of Jesus. Thanks to Bishop Tom and his brother Joe for helping us keep our eye on the Gospel prize through sports. I do wonder: who won when they played against each other?" --<b>Greg Dobie Moser</b>, Former Executive Director, National CYO Sports, Member of the US Olympic Committee</p><p><br>"A bishop who runs marathons and plays hockey?! Our Catholic faith is so cool! Just as Jesus taught about the kingdom and the way to peace using familiar metaphors, Bishop Paprocki draws on our love of sports to teach essential truths of the faith. <i>Holy Goals for Body and Soul</i> integrates relatable physical objectives with practical spiritual progression, training readers to set their sights on the Lord. --<b>Cindy Black</b>, Director of Youth, Young Adult and Campus Ministry, Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend</p></p><h2>Feynman&#39;s Thesis: A New Approach to Quantum Theory</h2><p>Richard Feynman&#39;s never previously published doctoral thesis formed the heart of much of his brilliant and profound work in theoretical physics. Entitled &#34;The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics, &#39; its original motive was to quantize the classical action-at-a-distance electrodynamics. Because that theory adopted an overall space-time viewpoint, the classical Hamiltonian approach used in the conventional formulations of quantum theory could not be used, so Feynman turned to the Lagrangian function and the principle of least action as his points of departure.The result was the path integral approach, which satisfied -- and transcended -- its original motivation, and has enjoyed great success in renormalized quantum field theory, including the derivation of the ubiquitous Feynman diagrams for elementary particles. Path integrals have many other applications, including atomic, molecular, and nuclear scattering, statistical mechanics, quantum liquids and solids, Brownian motion, and noise theory. It also sheds new light on fundamental issues like the interpretation of quantum theory because of its new overall space-time viewpoint.The present volume includes Feynman&#39;s Princeton thesis, the related review article &#34;Space-Time Approach to Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&#34; [Reviews of Modern Physics 20 (1948), 367-387], Paul Dirac&#39;s seminal paper &#34;The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics&#39;&#39; [Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion, Band 3, Heft 1 (1933)], and an introduction by Laurie M Brown.</p><p>The path integral approach is now something that every graduate student in theoretical physics is supposed to know ... the thesis provides a very good background for the way these ideas came about. The two companion articles, although available in print, also gives a complete picture of the development of this line of thinking. The helpful introductory remarks by the editor also puts things in the proper historical perspective. This book would be very helpful to anyone interested in the development of modern ideas in physics.</p><h2>Madness and Memory: The Discovery of Prions--A New Biological Principle of Disease</h2><p><b>A first-person account of a revolutionary scientific discovery that is now helping to unravel the mysteries of brain diseases</b><br><br> In 1997, Stanley B. Prusiner received a Nobel Prize, the world's most prestigious award for&nbsp;achievement in physiology or medicine. That he was the sole recipient of the award for the year was entirely appropriate. His struggle to identify the agent responsible for ravaging the brains of animals suffering from scrapie and mad cow disease, and of humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, had been waged largely alone and in some cases in the face of strenuous disagreement.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this book, Prusiner tells the remarkable story of his discovery of prions&#x2014;infectious proteins that replicate and cause disease but surprisingly contain no genetic material&#x2014;and reveals how superb and meticulous science is actually practiced with talented teams of researchers who persevere. He recounts the frustrations and rewards of years of research and offers fascinating portraits of his peers as they raced to discover the causes of fatal brain diseases. Prusiner&#x2019;s hypothesis, once considered heresy, now stands as accepted science and the basis for developing diagnoses and eventual cures. He closes with a meditation on the legacy of his discovery: What will it take to cure Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s and other devastating diseases of the brain?</p><p><b>Stanley B. Prusiner, M.D.,</b> is director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases and professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. The recipient of an array of scientific honors, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997.

Rather, the author shows science today as it really is: competitive, crowded with too many people trying to get funding, involving sometimes massive egos at play instead of the search for truth, and rife with naysayers&#x2019; refusal to accept new ideas in spite of the data. Prusiner shows the science game as it is too often played today, and we are all better for his sharing."&#x2014;Donald F. Calbreath, <i>New York Journal of Books</i> (Donald F. Calbreath <i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>"<i>Madness and Memory</i> is a fascinating account of scientific research, discovery, and controversy that will be of interest to many readers within neurology and neuroscience, as well as anyone drawn to the creative process."&#x2014;<i>Neurology Today</i> (Christopher M. Filley <i>Neurology Today</i>)<br><br>"A wonderful account of the multiple obstacles confronted by Stanley Prusiner as he transformed an unconventional hypothesis into one of the greatest discoveries of modern science."&#x2015;Robert J. Alpern, M.D., Dean, Yale University School of Medicine (Robert J. Alpern 2013-09-23)</p><h2>Ulysses</h2><p>The Dublin Illustrated Edition of Ulysses, endorsed by The James Joyce Centre, meticulously recreates the 1922 text. Ulysses chronicles the passage of Leopold Bloom through Dublin during an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses&#39; stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose: full of puns, parodies, and allusions, as well as its rich characterizations and broad humor, made the book a highly regarded novel in the Modernist pantheon. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Ulysses first on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. This is the first edition ever published in Ireland.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language. <p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p> <p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The first edition of Ulysses legally available in the United States was the Modern Library edition of 1934 issued after Random House defended the book against charges of obscenity. This volume reproduces the 1934 edition as corrected and reset in 1961. It includes a letter from James Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of the 1934 text; the decision by Judge John M. Woolsey lifting the ban on Ulysses; and a forward by Morris L. Ernst; who defended the book at the trial.</p><h2>The Civil War Letters of Alexander McNeill, 2nd South Carolina Infantry Regiment</h2><p>During the American Civil War, Alexander "Sandy" McNeill, a southern merchant, served in the Secession Guards, Company F, and Second South Carolina Regiment from April 17, 1861, to May 2, 1865. Within three weeks after the war began at Fort Sumter, McNeill wrote his first epistle to his long-time friend, Almirah Haseltine "Tinie" Simmons, in a campaign to win her heart and hand in marriage. The 29-year-old McNeill proclaimed in that letter, "I have always esteemed you as a friend and now I feel stealing over me a feeling which tells me that you are now held in higher estimation than that of a friend." <br><br>Civil War historian and documentary editor Mac Wyckoff adds context to the correspondence, more than two hundred letters that encompass the entire duration of the war. With the exception of three breaks in communication, McNeill wrote to Tinie four to five times a week and persisted to the last week of April 1865, more than two weeks after General Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. In general, letters written during the final six months of the war are hard to find as are many other primary source materials for the waning war. <br><br>While this is among the largest and fullest Civil War collections, it is the literary quality of McNeill's letters and wide variety of topics reported that distinguish it from others. In frequent and lengthy missives, McNeill opened his heart and mind to Tinie, his fianc�e and then wife. He fulsomely reported his experiences and thoughts on a soldier's life during this war, describing combat, camp life, the building of winter quarters, the marches, company election of officers, weather, food, and morale. McNeill chronicled his experiences at First Manassas (Bull Run), Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and other battles. A man of sophisticated opinions, McNeill voiced his personal views on political, religious and military events, and the names of fellow soldiers he liked and disliked&#x2015;all illuminating his deep, dynamic character.</p><p>Mac Wyckoff is a retired National Park Service historian who served at the Shiloh, Chickamauga, and Fredericksburg National Military Parks for forty years. He is the author of A History of the 2nd South Carolina Infantry, 1861-1865 and A History of the 3rd South Carolina Infantry, 1861-1865 and co-author of The Legacy of a Common Civil War Soldier: Private Thomas Marion Shields, A Collection of 34 Letters, 1861-1865.<br><br>Cora Lee Godsey Starling, the great granddaughter of Alexander "Sandy" McNeill, transcribed the letters over a twelve-year period."Mac Wycoff was a fortunate choice to edit the McNeill letters. The author of two published histories of the 2nd South Carolina, Wycoff brought to the task an intimate knowledge of Kershaw's command. I am short on criticism and long on praise for this remarkable collection of letters."&#x2015;<i>Civil War News</i><p>"Alexander McNeill of Kershaw's South Carolina brigade fought through most of the war with the Army of Northern Virginia, often in desperate moments and in dramatic scenes. His letters afford a rich perspective on four years of war, including a description of wading into the 'the terrible missiles of death' at Gettysburg."&#x2015;Robert K. Krick, author of Stonewall Jackson at Cedar Mountain</p><p>"Historian Mac Wyckoff has used his expert knowledge of Kershaw's Brigade to provide accurate settings and appropriate commentary for Sandy McNeill's exquisitely written and very personal letters to his wife. These nearly weekly accounts of a soldier's thoughts of the war and his concerns of home provide a good understanding of what it was like to fight in this complex and cruel war."&#x2015;DeWitt Boyd Stone, Jr., author of Wandering to Glory: Confederate Veterans Remember Evans' Brigade</p></p><h2>The Oxford History of the French Revolution</h2><p>Massacres were nothing new to the late eighteenth-century world, but the prospect of a government systematically executing its opponents by the cartload for months on end presented Europe with a new and unimaginable horror. The Reign of Terror and the French Revolution as a whole transformed the meaning of political change and history itself. Written by a leading historian, this authoritative and comprehensive history draws on a wealth of new research in order to reassess the greatest of all revolutions.<br> Beginning with the accession of Louis XVI in 1774, William Doyle traces the history of France through revolution, terror, and counter-terror, to the triumph of Napoleon in 1802, along the way analyzing the impact of these events in France upon the rest of Europe. He explores how a movement which began with optimism and general enthusiasm soon became a tragedy, not only for the ruling orders, but for millions of ordinary people all over Europe. They were the ones who paid the price for the destruction of the old political order and the struggle to establish a new one, based on liberty and revolution, in the face of widespread indifference and hostility. Highly readable and meticulously researched, <em>The Oxford History of the French Revolution</em> will provide new insights into one of the most important events in European history.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>William Doyle</strong> is Professor of History and Chairman of the School of History at the University of Bristol.

From the musings of literary geniuses like Mark Twain in <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> to the striking personal narrative of Harriet Jacobs in <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, this new series is a comprehensive collection of our literary history through the words of the exceptional few.<br><br><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s masterpiece and lone novel, has endured as a significant piece of literature partly due to its philosophical nature and artful prose, and partly because of the stir it caused upon its initial publication. Published originally in 1890 in <i>Lippincott&#x2019;s Magazine, The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> often deemed by Wilde&#x2019;s contemporaries to be indecent&#x201d; tells the story of an attractive young man eponymous with the title who desires to be eternally young. Dorian is the subject of a portrait by a painter named Basil Hallward, who deems Gray&#x2019;s beauty to be inconceivably great. Rather than having to age himself, young and egotistical Dorian longs for the painting to age instead so that he can remain young and beautiful. When he sells his soul in exchange for eternal youth a concept Wilde derived from the German legend of Faust Dorian begins a life of vice and debauchery with its sole aim being pleasure. Meanwhile, the painting documents each of his sins within its appearance. When Dorian confronts the painting again with Hallward, a slew of unfortunate events unfold.<br><br>Abundant with rich, philosophical themes and commentary, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is a classic tale that warns its readers of the dangers that come with narcissism, self-indulgence, and ignorance.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth.

The earlier chapters describe the quantum mechanics of various optical processes, leading from the classical representation of the electromagnetic field to the quantum theory of light. The later chapters develop the theoretical descriptions of some of the key experiments in quantum optics. Over half of the material in this Third Edition is new. It includes topics that have come into prominence over the last two decades, such as the beamsplitter theory, squeezed light, two-photon interference, balanced homodyne detection, travelling-wave attenuation and amplification, quantum jumps, and the ranges of nonlinear optical processes important in the generation of nonclassical light. The book is written as a textbook, with the treatment as a whole appropriate for graduate or postgraduate students, while earlier chapters are also suitable for final-year undergraduates.

Drawing on a vast amount of new evidence from his own excavations, the Director of the Akhenaten Temple Project describes the kingly heretic against the background of imperial Egypt.

"You going to shoot me when I come out?" Charlie said.<br><br>"No," I responded. "That's not going to happen. You said you wouldn't hurt anyone. You said you'd drop off the pilot somewhere in the mountains. So there's no reason for anyone to get hurt."<br><br>The logic of this formulation appeared to work for Charlie, perhaps because this was his only chance to go on living with Cheryl and their son, little Charlie.<br><br>But what I knew that he didn't was that somewhere out in the fields surrounding us, FBI marksmen were poised, waiting to take his life.<br><br>A large part of a negotiator's job is to establish trust, yet there are fundamental contradictions in that. In order to convince someone that despite all appearances to the contrary, everything will be okay, you have to project sincerity. You have to make him believe that what you are saying is honest and aboveboard. You have to address his primal need for safety and security by establishing a bond. And on rare occasions, you have to lie.<br><br>"Have you ever been on a helicopter before?" I asked.<br><br>"No," he said.<br><br>"You'll enjoy it. The view over the mountains will be spectacular." Of course, I knew that he would never take that ride or experience that view. Once again, the contradiction: he was hearing what he wanted to hear.<br><br>"Charlie," I said, "I need to ask you an important question."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"The helicopter pilot is an old friend of mine. His name is Tom Kelly. I've known and worked with Tom for many years, so I need your absolute promise that you won't harm him in any way. If anything happens to Tom, I would never be able to live with myself."<br><br>"I won't hurt him," Charlie said.<br><br>About ten days before, Charlie Leaf had abducted his estranged former common-law wife, Cheryl Hart, and their young son from her parents' home in Connecticut. After a seven-year relationship, Charlie and Cheryl had separated two years ago. When Cheryl had finally left him, she said she saw him snap. She moved in with her parents, trying to get on with her life, but Charlie, like so many men in such situations, was not willing to let her go. The way he saw it, Cheryl and little Charlie were his possessions, and he wanted them back. Over the next two years he threatened her and physically abused her whenever he found her. He had once even abducted little Charlie for six months, and gave up the boy only when the police intervened. Cheryl had sought and obtained a restraining order a year ago. The next day, right before he had to go to court, Charlie came to kill her.<br><br>It was on Friday, April 1, 1988, that Charlie cashed his paycheck and purchased a carbine rifle, sawing off the gunstock in order to conceal it. Then he drove to Cheryl's parents' house--they were away for the weekend--and pried open a door leading into the garage. He kicked in the door to Cheryl's bedroom with the rifle in his hand. He beat her and raped her before telling her to pack things for little Charlie. He told her that she could go or die.<br><br>Fortunately, Cheryl had the instincts of a survivor. She remained calm and said she would come; she convinced Charlie that he didn't have to kill her.<br><br>"We can go away," she said. "We can start a new life together with little Charlie."<br><br>Cheryl had made it clear by now that she wanted no part of Charlie, yet he wanted so much to believe her that this gleam of hope obscured his judgment. He gave her a few moments to get the boy out of bed and to gather up some clothes. Then they took off in Charlie's car.<br><br>Cheryl had no plan other than to try to stay alive. Charlie's plan, to the extent that he had one, was to avoid being caught. Both knew that Cheryl's parents would call the police the moment they discovered she was gone. Both were simply stalling for time.<br><br>Charlie drove south through the night along the eastern seaboard, and somewhere near the Washington, D.C., area headed west into the mountains of Virginia. Charlie liked mountains. When little Charlie was still an infant, he started to build a log cabin, which remained unfinished when Cheryl left him. Cheryl had grown tired of him, of the idea of living in a remote cabin, and of their relationship, and so she left.<br><br>On Saturday, April 2, about an hour and a half due west of Washington, D.C., Charlie's car ran out of gas. They abandoned it near Sperryville, Virginia, a scenic little town on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains.<br><br>The Virginia authorities found Charlie's car on Sunday. By this time, Cheryl's sister had reported her missing when she didn't show up to a planned dinner, so when the police ran the plates, they quickly connected this vehicle with the story of the abduction in Connecticut, then launched an all-out search.<br><br>Just outside Sperryville, a sleepy country village where tourists came in season to buy apples and view the fall colors, Charlie took his family once again into the woods. This time, he built a simple lean-to. They made their way to a nearby country store, where they purchased food and drinks and a few other supplies. Meanwhile, all around them, a search went on involving the local police, the Virginia State Police, and the FBI. Helicopters flew over the ridges and valleys, while teams on foot searched the woods with tracking dogs.<br><br>This went on for almost a week, by which time the authorities were ready to give up. Then on Friday the eighth, Charlie waited until after dark, then broke in to the same country store he had visited before and stole additional supplies. This confirmed for the police that their fugitive was still in the area, and the next morning they renewed their search. Investigating the burglary, the authorities showed photographs of Charlie, Cheryl, and little Charlie to the store owner, who made a positive identification.<br><br>The FBI's efforts in tracking down Charlie and his victims would be led by the Richmond, Virginia, SWAT team, with an assist from members of the SWAT team from the FBI Washington Field Office (WFO). Both groups are tactical operations specialists, that is, the ones who subdue the perpetrators if and when negotiations fail to bring an end to the crisis. In other words, their jobs do not involve establishing trust or empathy, or the contradictions attendant therein.<br><br>They made a house-to-house search of the area, and late in the afternoon on April 9, Special Agent Barry Subelsky and his team from the WFO SWAT approached a two-story farmhouse, a weekend getaway place for a successful Washington couple, less than a mile off the main road. The sunlight was fading fast, so they wanted to get this done as quickly as possible.<br><br>Barry conferred with Wayne Waddell, SWAT leader for the Richmond FBI office. These two experienced agents, both Vietnam combat veterans, decided that Barry's team would search the ground floor of the farmhouse and Wayne's team would then take the upstairs. Before they moved in, however, they saw something that made them cautious. The electric meter on the outside of the house was humming along at a brisk pace, more active than what one would expect in an unoccupied dwelling.<br><br>They summoned an FBI helicopter for support, and it landed in a field some hundred yards away, just as a local sheriff arrived with keys to the house.<br><br>Barry's team searched for signs of forced entry but found none. They came up on the rickety porch outside the kitchen and went in through the back door, then fanned out to secure the ground floor. Wayne and his team followed in single file up on the porch, through the kitchen and then the family room, turning the corner near the front entryway, then advancing, slowly and carefully, up the creaking main stairs to the second floor.<br><br>When Wayne got upstairs he found Charlie on the floor of the bedroom holding Cheryl and little Charlie in front of him, a gun to her head.<br><br>"Back off!" he yelled. "Back off or I'll kill her."<br><br>Wayne Waddell had spent hours training for situations just like this, and he knew exactly what to do.<br><br>"We're backing off," he said. "Nobody's going to get hurt."<br><br>He and the agents moved back down and clustered at the foot of the stairs.<br><br>Law enforcement often overreacts to threats of the kind that Charlie made, even though in most cases such threats are merely defensive, designed to keep the police at bay. Some law officers hear only the threatened action, "I'll kill this lady," while failing to hear the conditions under which that action will be taken: "if you try to come in here." That is one reason why the most critical skills of a negotiator are self-control and the ability to help those around you keep their cool.<br><br>Wayne had a lot on his mind as law enforcement settled in for the long haul. Mere chance had made him the group's primary negotiator, and his immediate task was to deescalate the confrontation, and then to convince Charlie that he was here to help him. But he also had to lead the SWAT team and coordinate the actions of the roughly twenty FBI personnel on the scene, as well as communicate all of this to his superiors.<br><br>Back in Sperryville, other agents and local police officials were setting up a command post at the local firehouse, from which all efforts would be coordinated. State police brought in an armored vehicle, one of those old Brink's trucks that had been converted to a forward command post, which they positioned about a hundred yards away from the farmhouse on the long drive leading to it. Sniper/observer teams took up positions in the nearby woods, and the men inside the house began to wait.<br><br>As dusk settled in, Wayne and his team decided to turn on the lights. Charlie didn't like this. In response he fired several shots at the lightbulb in the ceiling above the second-floor landing, shattering the bulb and sending shards of glass in all directions.<br><br>"Relax! Relax!" Wayne yelled. He kept his guys cool, avoiding what could have been a bloodbath right there and then. It was going to be a long night.<br><br>Wayne now realized he would need a trained negotiator to talk to Charlie. He called in another agent from the Richmond FBI office, Gray Hill, who soon arrived, still in civilian clothes, and assumed the task of talking to Charlie from the bottom of the stairs. Their conversations over the next couple of hours were sporadic, and in the few exchanges that took place Charlie remained adamant: he was not going to give up without hurting Cheryl and the boy. Hill was a veteran agent and had taken the FBI's two-week hostage-negotiation training course, but this was his first actual hostage situation. His job at this point was to relieve Wayne and hold the fort until a resolution strategy was in place. An hour went by, maybe two. Then Charlie called down with his first demand. "We need our clothes out of the dryer. We need you to get the clothes and bring them up here."<br><br>It actually had been Cheryl's idea to break in to the farmhouse, with clean clothes as the objective. There had been some wet weather in the mountains and she and the boy had been cold and miserable. She had convinced Charlie that they needed to take a warm bath and wash their clothes, which were still in the dryer when Wayne and his crew entered the house.<br><br>Gray was nothing if not cautious, a negotiator who would play it by the book, and the book says that you do not give a hostage taker anything without getting something in return. His answer to the request for the clothing was no. He did not want to empower Charlie by making concessions to him without getting something in return. But at the same time, he continued to emphasize the themes that Wayne had established: No one had been hurt. The charges that might be brought against Charlie at this point were not that serious. The FBI didn't want to see anyone hurt.<br><br>These are all standard tactics of hostage negotiation: to minimize the consequences the perpetrator will face once the siege is over, and to assure him that he won't be hurt if he surrenders. The other essential part of the message is that harming someone will only make matters worse. Even so, there are times when playing it by the book won't get the job done, and when a more experienced negotiator might be more willing to improvise. This would prove to be one of those times.<br><br>It was after one in the morning when the phone rang on the nightstand next to my bed in my home in Fairfax, Virginia. I heard a voice telling me that it was FBI headquarters, calling to tell me about what was going on in Sperryville and asking me to report to the command post there as soon as possible to assist with negotiations and eventually take over direct communication with Charlie. As the negotiation coordinator for the Washington Field Office, I'd been involved with previous such incidents and I knew the drill.<br><br>While I would have preferred this call at a more convenient hour, I felt the usual charge of excitement that comes with responding to cases of this kind. I quickly jumped out of bed, threw on my clothes, and told my wife, Carol, that I would call her when I could. This was my job, like it or not. I had just come back from an assignment overseas and my FBI car--my "G-ride"--was still parked at the office, which meant that I would have to take the family station wagon. As I got in the car and backed out of the driveway, the absolute calm of the quiet suburban street once again reminded me how different my life was from that of my neighbors.<br><br>The trip would normally take about ninety minutes, driving out of Fairfax through Warrenton. My family and I had been to Sperryville the previous year to pick apples, so I knew the way. There was almost no traffic at this time of night, and, not having my light and siren, I edged over the speed limit cautiously and made it in about an hour. When I reached the command post at the fire station in town I was given directions to the farmhouse a little ways up the road. I was told to speak to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC), Virgil Young.<br><br>I showed my identification to the trooper on the scene, parked near the armored truck serving as the forward command post, and approached the small group of men standing out in the cold.</p><h2>Whitney Biennial 2014</h2><p><b>A striking accompaniment to the 2014 biennial exhibition, which presents the perspectives of three innovative guest curators</b><br><br> The Whitney Biennial, the Museum&#x2019;s signature exhibition, has charted some of the most exciting new work in contemporary art since it was first introduced in 1932.

It is also the most decadent of the great Russian classics, replete with naked boys, sinuous girls, and a strange mixture of beauty and perversity. The main hero, Peredonov, is as comical as he is disgusting. He is at once a victim, a monster, a silly hypocrite, and a sadistic dullard. The plot moves from Peredonov&#x2019;s petty quest for a promotion to arson and murder via one of the most incredible and uproarious scandal scenes in world literature, the masquerade ball, which the boy Sasha attends as a beautiful geisha. Even in its censored form, it is one of the most provocative and sexually open of Russian books. Sologub removed many passages which would have been unacceptable at the time of publication. In this edition these censored sections are appended, and all are keyed so that the reader can place them in the novel as it was written.</p><p>By profession a schoolteacher and a poet, one of the earliest Russian symbolists, Fyodor Sologub (1863-1927) began his literary career in 1896 with a volume of verse, a collection of tales, and a novel, Bad Dreams, which described the squalid existence of a schoolmaster.

Baruch (1899-1964) could outride, outshoot, outhunt, and outsail most of the young men of her elite social circle&#x2015;abilities that distanced her from other debutantes of 1917. Unapologetic for her athleticism and interests in traditionally masculine pursuits, Baruch towered above male and female counterparts in height and daring. While she is known today for the wildlife conservation and biological research center on the South Carolina coast that bears her family name, Belle's story is a rich narrative about one nonconformist's ties to the land. In Baroness of Hobcaw, Mary E. Miller provides a provocative portrait of this unorthodox woman who gave a gift of monumental importance to the scientific community.<br><br>Belle's father, Bernard M. Baruch, the so-called Wolf of Wall Street, held sway over the financial and diplomatic world of the early twentieth century and served as an adviser to seven U.S. presidents. In 1905 he bought Hobcaw Barony, a sprawling seaside retreat where he entertained the likes of Churchill and FDR. Belle's daily life at Hobcaw reflects the world of wealthy northerners, including the Vanderbilts and Luces, who bought tracts of southern acreage. Miller details Belle's exploits&#x2015;fox hunting at Hobcaw, show jumping at Deauville, flying her own plane, traveling with Edith Bolling Wilson, and patrolling the South Carolina beach for spies during World War II. Belle's story also reveals her efforts to win her mother's approval and her father's attention, as well as her unraveling relationships with friends, family, employees, and lovers&#x2015;both male and female. Miller describes Belle's final success in saving Hobcaw from development as the overarching triumph of a tempestuous life.</p><p>The riveting biography of an heiress, equestrienne, spy-hunter, and patron of ecologyAfter a twenty-five-year career in journalism, Mary E. Miller left the world of magazine and newspaper writing to enter Washington Theological Union in Washington, D.C., where she earned an M.A. in pastoral studies. Miller is now a spiritual director and retreat leader who lives in Surfside Beach, South Carolina.</p><h2>Strategic Family Therapy (JOSSEY BASS SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE SERIES)</h2><p>"Madanes' lucid, coherent, and practical guide for family therapists is a welcome addition to the proliferating literature by family therapy theorists and practitioners....

Cantor's own faith in his theory was partly theological. His religious beliefs led him to expect paradoxes in any concept of the infinite, and he always retained his belief in the utter veracity of transfinite set theory. Later in his life, he was troubled by recurring attacks of severe depression. Dauben shows that these played an integral part in his understanding and defense of set theory.</p></p><p>One of the greatest revolutions in mathematics occurred when Georg Cantor promulgated his theory of tranfinite sets.

At the time, the very idea of a virus underlying a cancer was revolutionary. Cancer is, after all, not catching. Even now, the idea of a virus causing cancer surprises many people. But Epstein-Barr, named after its discoverers, Sir Anthony Epstein and Dr Yvonne Barr, is fascinating for other reasons too. Almost everyone carries it, yet it is only under certain circumstances that it produces disease. It has been associated with different, apparently unrelated, diseases in different populations: Burkitt's Lymphoma, producing tumors in the jaw, in African children; a nasal tumor in China; glandular fever in Europe and the USA; and the majority of cases of Hodgkin's Disease everywhere. <br><br>This book tells the story of the discovery of the virus, and the recognition of its connection with these various diseases -- an account that spans the world and involves some remarkable characters and individual stories.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dorothy H.

It is also an example of clinical sophistication of the very highest order.&#39; DJeffrey J. Andresen &#39;A major strength of this book is that it addresses the difficult situations that arise in treatment when projection is at play. The difficult feelings aroused in the projective introjective interplay are explored and the therapist is cautioned repeatedly against using untimely interpretations rather than therapeutic containment and holding feelings `in reverie.&#39; The patient needs the space to grow and Ogden is quite sensitive to this process.&#39; DJanet Schumacher Finell A Jason Aronson Book</p><p>Thomas H.

He teaches, supervises, and maintains a private practice of psychoanalysis in San Francisco.Two things you should know about this book: The first is that Dr. Ogden illuminates some of the experiences with patients that we must bear in order to be of help. The second is that Dr. Ogden&#39;s writing offers us a sense of the attitudes and aptitudes which are the attainment of such extraordinary clinicians as Elvin Semrad. This latter aspect of the book makes it particularly special, for to deliver in print the feeling and spirit of the finest clinical thinking is a remarkable achievement.

It is certainly a good thing to have pride in one's country, in one's community, in oneself. But when taken too far, as Michael Eric Dyson shows in <em>Pride</em>, these virtues become deadly sins.<br><br>Dyson, named by <em>Ebony</em> magazine as one of the 100 most influential African Americans, here looks at the many dimensions of pride. Ranging from Augustine and Aquinas, MacIntyre and Hauerwas, to Niebuhr and King, Dyson offers a thoughtful, multifaceted look at this "virtuous vice." He probes the philosophical and theological roots of pride in examining its transformation in Western culture. Dyson discusses how black pride keeps blacks from being degraded and excluded by white pride, which can be invisible, unspoken, but nonetheless very powerful. Dyson also offers a moving glimpse into the teachers and books that shaped his personal pride and vocation. Dyson also looks at less savory aspects of national pride. Since 9/11, he notes, we have had to close ranks. But the collective embrace of all things American, to the exclusion of anything else, has taken the place of a much richer, much more enduring, much more profound version of love of country. This unchecked pride asserts the supremacy of America above all others--elevating our national beliefs above any moral court in the world--and attacking critics of American foreign policy as unpatriotic and even traitorous. <br><br>Hubris, temerity, arrogance--the unquestioned presumption that one's way of life defines how everyone else should live--pride has many destructive manifestations. In this engaging and energetic volume, Michael Eric Dyson, one of the nation's foremost public intellectuals, illuminates this many-sided human emotion, one that can be an indispensable virtue or a deadly sin.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Eric Dyson</strong> is Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities, and Professor of Religious Studies and Africana Studies, at the University of Pennsylvania.

O'Donnell, Provost, Georgetown University, and author of <em>Augustine: A New Biography</em><p></p><br>"Dyson examines pride in its many iterations, invoking pop culture icons and events to lend accessibility to a potentially didactic subject....

In <i>Closer</i>, <i>Frisk</i>, and <i>Try</i>, Cooper delineated the existential crisis of gay teen boys with no place to go but down, nothing to look forward to but death. Cooper's plots usually revolve around the idea that there are people--usually older men--who are willing to help them with this last desire. Cooper tells a similar tale in <i>Guide,</i> but has placed himself in the middle of the action as a participant. Beautifully and chillingly written, <i>Guide</i> is Cooper's most disturbing, transgressive tale yet. A visionary masterpiece as sublime as it is frightening.Narrated in a voice that at times may be construed as the author&#39;s own, Guide is the story of the conflict between a novelist&#39;s fantasy life and his inability to represent it in language. Remembering the clarity and omnipotence he felt during an LSD trip in his teens, &#34;Dennis&#34; drops acid and attempts to write a novel that will make sense of his life, his desires, his friends, and his art, and distinguish what is real from the distortions created by his overactive imagination. Dennis&#39;s sexual relationship with Chris - an addict who fantasizes about being killed - pushes him to the very edge of emotions he has only imagined. His platonic love for Luke, an imaginative, but far more innocent, friend, offers possible salvation from his otherwise crazy life. In episodic chapters that criss-cross through time, Guide weaves together Dennis&#39;s story with these and other characters, including Goof, a young and amazingly innocent porn star, Sniffles, a teenage runaway whose need for love outweighs his attachment to life, and Mason, whose lurid desires are rivaled only by Dennis&#39;s own.</p><h2>Nutritional Assessment</h2><p>This text describes the four major methods of nutritional assessment (dietary, anthropometric, biometric, and clinical) in an understandable and contemporary way.

Highly recommended.&#34;--Library Journal.</p><p><i>On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead: Basic Concepts of the Kabbalah</i> is Gershom Scholem's introduction to the essential terms of Jewish mysticism. His chapter on Shekhinah--the kabbalist symbol of the female element of the godhead--helps explain why Kabbalah has a growing following among women. His chapter on Gilgul, or reincarnation, is fascinating for its description of how a spiritual phenomenon is formed, following the process from revelation to writing to teaching. And his final chapter on Tselem, or the astral body, will make you think twice about laughing at Shirley MacLaine. The astral body, according to Kabbalah, is the spiritual nature of each human being--the image of God described in Genesis 1. Scholem quotes pages of medieval rabbis' fantastic discoveries of their astral bodies, such as the following: <blockquote>When I wished to find knowledge of the secrets of Creation, I came upon a dark vault within the depths of the earth, filled with blowing winds.... Then there appeared to me in my sleep a shape of most wondrous beauty [giving me instructions on how to conduct myself in order to attain knowledge of the highest things]. I then said to him: "Who are you?" And he answered: "I am your perfected nature."</blockquote> <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Gershom Scholem was a professor of Jewish mysticism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem until his death in 1982. Among his most important works are <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, The Messianic Idea in Judaism,</i> and <i>On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism.</i></p><h2>The Tempest The Graphic Novel (American English, Original Text)</h2><p>Cast onto the waters by his power-hungry brother Antonio, Prospero, the Duke of Milan, has been living on a distant island for a dozen years along with his daughter Miranda. In his years of banishment, Prospero has developed strong magical powers powers that not only allow him to deduce that Antonio is on a nearby ship, but to cause the ship to run aground. At long last, Prospero has a chance to get revenge on those who have wronged him. But, will he also ruin Miranda&#x2019;s chance for happiness? <i>The Tempest</i> is considered by many critics to be Shakespeare&#x2019;s crowning glory. This full-color graphic novel presents the sparkling romantic comedy just as Shakespeare intended: in its original and unabridged format, and in its original setting. As with the other titles in this well-received series, it encourages readers to discover classical literature while staying true to Shakespeare&#x2019;s vision. Also available are a Plain Text version, translated into modern U.S. English, and a Quick Text version, with less dialogue for a fast-paced read.</p><p>William Shakespeare is one of the most widely read authors and possibly the best dramatist ever to live. The actual date of his birth is not known, but traditionally April 23rd 1564 (St George&#39;s Day) has been his accepted birthday, as this was three days before his baptism. He died on the same date in 1616, aged fifty-two.The life of William Shakespeare can be divided into three acts. The first twenty years of his life were spent in Stratford-upon-Avon where he grew up, went to school, got married and became a father. The next twenty-five years he spent as an actor and playwright in London; and he spent his last few years back in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he enjoyed his retirement in moderate wealth gained from his successful years in the theatre.William was the eldest son of tradesman John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, and the third of eight children. His father was later elected mayor of Stratford, which was the highest post a man in civic politics could attain. In sixteenth-century England, William was lucky to survive into adulthood; syphilis, scurvy, smallpox, tuberculosis, typhus and dysentery shortened life expectancy at the time to approximately thirty-five years. The Bubonic Plague took the lives of many and was believed to have been the cause of death for three of William&#39;s seven siblings. Little is known of William&#39;s childhood, other than it is thought that he attended the local grammar school, where he studied Latin and English Literature. In 1582, at the age of eighteen, William married a local farmer&#39;s daughter, Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior and three months pregnant. During their marriage they had three children: Susanna, born on May 26th 1583 and twins, Hamnet and Judith, born on February 2nd 1585. Hamnet, William&#39;s only son, caught Bubonic Plague and died aged just eleven. Five years into his marriage William moved to London and appeared in many small parts at The Globe Theatre, then one of the biggest theatres in England. His first appearance in public as a poet was in 1593 with &#34;Venus and Adonis&#34; and again in the following year with &#34;The Rape of Lucrece&#34;. Six years later, in 1599, he became joint proprietor of The Globe Theatre.When Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, she was succeeded by her cousin King James of Scotland. King James supported Shakespeare and his band of actors and gave them license to call themselves &#34;The King&#39;s Men&#34; in return for entertaining the court. In just twenty-three years, between 1590 and 1613, William Shakespeare is attributed with writing thirty-eight plays, one-hundred-and-fifty-four sonnets and five poems. No original manuscript exists for any of his plays, so it is hard to accurately date them. However, from their contents and reports of the day it is believed that his first play was A&#34;The Taming of the ShrewA&#34; and that his last complete work was A&#34;Two Noble KinsmenA&#34;, written two years before he died. The cause of his death remains unknown.He was buried on April 25th 1616,two days after his death, at the Church of the Holy Trinity (the same Church where he had been baptised fifty-two years earlier). His gravestone bears these words, believed to have been written by William himself:- &#34;Good friend for Jesus sake forbear,To dig the dust enclosed here!Blest be the man that spares these stones,And curst be he that moves my bones&#34;At the time of his death, William had substantial properties, which he bestowed on his family and associates from the theatre. In his will he left his wife, the former Anne Hathaway, his second best bed!William Shakespeare&#39;s last direct descendant died in 1670. She was his granddaughter, Elizabeth.*Starred Review* In the Shakespearean graphic novel crowd, if Gareth Hinds&#x2019; adaptations are subtle and thoughtful artists, and the Manga Shakespeare series are wild, unpredictable rock stars, then the Classical Comics series might be the no-nonsense teachers of the group. With straightforward draftsmanship and three text versions (original, plain, and quick), Classical Comics titles are ready-made to lure intimidated students and aid in curricular comparisons that highlight the levels on which Shakespeare works. But with the publication of the original version of The Tempest, this solid, practical series has just added its first superstar. In vibrant color that far outmatches the standard, somber &#x201c;historical&#x201d; palette, the bitter and over-protective Prospero, looking like an extra-psychedelic Doctor Strange, maroons King Alonso and his men on his magical island. All the great strengths of the sequential art form are brought to bear, with creative panel shape and size, border textures, word balloon effects, dynamic motion, and magical figure work that makes the fairies sparkle and the harpy blaze like an inferno. It&#x2019;s such a resounding success that readers may actually forget they&#x2019;re learning something. Of the multitudinous Shakespeare graphic adaptations now available, this is the first to take total advantage of the medium&#x2019;s full potential, appropriately aligned to the Bard&#x2019;s most fantastical work.

Maybe you stress yourself out over a request from your boss that turns out to be nothing, or you eat an entire family-size bag of popcorn because you didn't plan ahead while at the grocery store, or you turn down an opportunity because you're just not sure you can handle it. Whatever your situation, there's a common theme-you're getting in your own way.<br><br> In The Healthy Mind Toolkit, you'll discover the ways in which you're holding yourself back and how to leave that behavior behind. I'll help you escape from self-defeating traps so you can enjoy a clear, calm mind and more productivity, freedom, and resilience.<br><br> Together, we'll identify where you go wrong with your decision making. Then I'll help you put together a personalized toolkit of the skills you'll need for optimizing your thoughts and actions, which we'll tailor to your nature, lifestyle, and preferences. The result will be that you'll feel more relaxed, you'll sense your life is on the right track, and you'll have enough mental energy to withstand everyday stress and take on meaningful personal challenges.<br><br> The book is divided into five sections: understanding yourself, foundation skills, correcting thinking errors, relationships psychology, and finally, work and money. In modern life, most of us don't have any spare time or willpower for implementing ideas that are excessively complicated and exhausting. You need easy, practical solutions, which is exactly what you'll learn here. We'll work on both knowing what to do to achieve more of what you want and how to do what you know, so that you can successfully implement your insights and the book's tools.<br><br> Self-defeating behaviors are quite common, so you're certainly not alone in having this problem. And while each person's unique thought patterns and habits will be their own, there's a lot of overlap across people too. I can personally relate to many of the problem patterns we'll work through. In many cases, I've found simple solutions that work for me consistently. I've got strategies that prevent me from experiencing self-generated stress, or I can easily spot self-sabotage when I'm doing it and correct it on the fly. For example, I'm much better than I used to be at taking breaks, switching off my phone, prioritizing what I work on, seeing and implementing the simplest solutions to challenges, maintaining a balance between being cautious and carefree (preventing excessive worrying and ruminating), and not being penny wise but pound foolish.<br><br> In some cases, I find my self-sabotaging actions are harder to consistently prevent. I tend to react to change and surprises with anxiety-driven defensiveness. For example, a friend recently suggested she coordinate her vacation with my family's existing plans to visit a mutual friend of ours. My initial (internal) reaction was "Accommodating three sets of babies' nap schedules is going to be such a pain." However, I know myself well enough to spot this negative thinking as my typical first reaction to virtually any proposed change of plans. Sure enough, within a few minutes of thinking it over I realized the positives of all three of us getting together would far outweigh any minor scheduling and planning issues. My knee-jerk hesitation quickly shifted to feeling really excited about seeing both friends. Likewise, if someone makes an unexpected request of me, I often overestimate what the person is asking me to do. It's only later when I've stepped back and gotten perspective that whatever has been asked of me seems achievable and not a big deal (or even positive). When it comes to handling trickier requests (for example, being asked to do something I don't want to do), an easy compromise or alternative solution frequently seems obvious once I've had time to digest and process what has been asked. Although I have good insight into my patterns in this area, I don't always manage to hide my initial defensiveness at the time, and I sometimes need to go back and "clean up," apologize, or correct my attitude after the fact.<br><br> Ideally, using what you'll read here, you'll discover strategies for preventing your self-sabotaging behaviors from occurring. Realistically, you'll probably find yourself doing a mixture of prevention and treating the wound, as I do. You'll permanently solve some problem habits, but a few will remain works in progress. I'll help you learn how to respond constructively when these types of ongoing patterns occur, so you don't go spiraling into harsh self-criticism and rumination or blaming others unfairly. That way you can limit (or even reverse) any negative impact of your tendencies on yourself and your relationships.<br><br> Interestingly, many self-sabotaging patterns that look unrelated on the surface are actually two sides of the same coin. Here are some common examples. Can you relate to any of the following?<br><br> You:<br><br> Have too much chaos in your life, and not enough structure and routine.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stick too rigidly to self-imposed rules and routines.<br><br> Give up too soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Persist too much.<br><br> Get excited and rush into action, without enough thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Overthink and delay action because you never feel 100 percent sure.<br><br> Have a thinking style that's too optimistic. You focus mainly on the potential upside of actions and don't pay enough attention to potential problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have a thinking style that's too pessimistic. You shoot down good ideas, sweat the small stuff, and hold back from potentially wonderful opportunities.<br><br> Fail to reflect on and learn from past mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ruminate about the past and are prone to feeling excessive guilt and shame. <br><br> Have a "now" focus.

You don't recognize that rules often have hidden flexibility or gray areas.<br><br> Are too self-sacrificing.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are too self-centered and self-serving.<br><br> As you can see from the examples, there are many, many different self-defeating processes (some related to each other, some not). Even very widespread patterns don't manifest in exactly the same way for every individual. Rather than attempting to include every type of self-sabotage (which would fill a library rather than a single book), I'll provide simple, actionable tips for how to tackle the most common self-defeating patterns and teach you the principles behind these suggestions so you can adapt them for your precise needs. The more you customize the material from the book to address your specific habits, the better you'll understand it. And if anything you read here doesn't gel for you, feel free to ignore it. I'll give you plenty of options so you can choose what suits you best. By the end of the book, you'll have a set of specific solutions to apply in your life and a general toolkit for understanding your problem tendencies and successfully working through them.<br><br> The explanations and tips you'll read here are based mainly on cognitive behavioral theories and research. The term cognitive behavioral sounds formal, but it just means tweaking both your thinking and your behavior to have maximum positive impact. The dual emphasis is important because changing your behavior tends to be one of the quickest and most effective ways to change your thinking. A healthy mind starts with healthy behaviors, which is why this book includes many strategies that are focused on behavior, and why we'll concentrate in depth on the links between actions and thoughts. To truly declutter your mind, you'll need to streamline your behavior and switch out unconscious problem habits for more deliberate choices.<br><br> Cognitive behavioral approaches have been extensively studied, mostly as treatments for mental health difficulties. Decades of research have shown that cognitive behavioral strategies are a very effective approach for making emotional and behavioral changes. Many common mental health problems, like anxiety and depression, include significant amounts of self-defeating behaviors, and these contribute to how people can get sucked into spirals of rumination (overthinking about the past), worry (overthinking about the future), and low mood. So although the book isn't specifically focused on alleviating mental health problems, if you have depression or anxiety, you can expect that the strategies I've included will be also helpful for those issues.<br><br> You Don't Need to Completely Eliminate Self-Sabotage<br><br> Your goal for using this book doesn't need to be to completely eliminate self-sabotage. In reality, that probably wouldn't be useful because life is so full of competing demands and wants and limited time and energy. A better goal is to identify and eliminate the patterns that are the most damaging to your health, happiness, and relationships. For example, putting off calling a friend isn't the same as putting off making a doctor's appointment after you've noticed a misshapen mole that could be a skin cancer. I'll help you figure out what's important to focus on minimizing and what's okay to leave as is. It's more critical to concentrate on the self-defeating behaviors that have the most harmful effects on you, rather than the frequency or number you do. By prioritizing the patterns that have the most significant potential consequences for you, you'll eliminate the majority of the negative impact that self-sabotage has in your life.<br><br> Goal Setting<br><br> A Catch-22 you may encounter as you progress through this book is that many self-sabotaging patterns also get in the way of overcoming self-sabotage. Great, right? Not prioritizing and trying to do it all is one example of this. To prevent this from happening, let's look at several different approaches you could take to prioritize the material in the book. Picking one of these options now will prevent you from trying to change all your self-defeating ways at once, becoming overwhelmed, and giving up.<br><br> Option 1: Calculate what a good return would be from your investment in this book and set a specific, achievable goal to obtain that. For example, for the money you paid for it and the hours you spent reading it and absorbing the advice and suggestions, you'd like to identify and improve five self-defeating patterns.<br><br> Option 2: If self-defeating patterns are having a big impact in only one domain of your life (for example, relationships or your career), you might choose to work through the material that relates to that domain thoroughly and read the rest of the book for interest, without the expectation of action.<br><br> Option 3: If you're more motivated by taking a well-rounded approach, you might decide to implement one change in each of five life domains-general self-regulation, organization, relationships, work, and money. Or you might choose to implement one positive change from each chapter of the book.<br><br> Experiment<br><br> From the suggestions just given, identify your initial goal for reading The Healthy Mind Toolkit. What would you like to gain from applying the tips and strategies in your life? You can always pick further goals after you've achieved your primary objectives. If you set the bar too high initially, you'll end up feeling overloaded.<br><br> If you're worried you may not have the willpower to get through this book and then go back and start implementing the advice you like best, you can always pause when you reach an insight you want to apply in your life. Practice it until it's routine and then pick up where you left off in the book. This approach is likely to be particularly useful if you tend to be an "all research, no action" type of person.<br><br> Expect Your Insight into Your Patterns to Fluctuate<br><br> Before I became an author, I worked as a clinical psychologist in private practice in my country of birth, New Zealand. A pattern I observed was this: A client and I would spend a session untangling a specific problem. The client would seem to have gained insight into their pattern, and would leave the session feeling satisfied they'd acquired new understanding and tools. Fast-forward a few weeks, a month, or even the very next week, and the client would report a situation that was fundamentally the same issue that we'd worked through previously. However, to the client the situations seemed different. Therefore, it didn't occur to them to use the strategies they'd already learned in the new situation.<br><br> If you notice this happening to you, be aware that it's a known problem. It's not you, it's everyone. Frequently, it doesn't occur to us to translate insights and skills we've learned from one specific situation to other settings where they would be equally effective. In the moment, similar situations often seem completely distinct and unrelated to us. Sometimes it takes a while to get a really good handle on your repetitive patterns, but with patience, self-compassion, and perseverance, you'll get there. Expect the occasional face-palm moment when you recognize you've slipped into a familiar pattern you thought you'd resolved.

Her easy techniques in <i>Quilting Curves</i> ensure that your designs come together quickly, with beautiful, graceful results--even for beginners. Ideal for machine quilters, Pignatelli shows you how to make wonderful, flowing curves and perfect star points without the tricky needle turn or precise piecing techniques that traditional quiltmaking involves. She demonstrates how to use a variation on her method for creating three-dimensional effects. A chapter on creativity provides you with the tools to start creating quilts of your own design.</p> <p> </p><ul> <li>Fast, fun, and easy quilt tops that would take weeks to piece using conventional methods come together in hours </li><li>Trouble-free�� quilts appear to be intricately pieced but are easy to topstitch by machine </li><li>Eight complete patterns help you master the technique before moving on to create quilts of your own design </li></ul> <p></p></p><p>Piecing curved designs is often a quilter's nightmare, but Vikki Pignatelli's intriguing new technique can take the intimidation out of this daunting task. As presented in <i>Quilting Curves</i>, Pignatelli's method involves surface-pieced appliqu� layering using freezer-paper templates and foundation stabilizer. Worked up gradually in jigsaw-puzzle fashion, the individual fabric elements emerge into grandly flowing, swirling designs. Thorough directions and complete pattern templates walk us through nine quilt projects; however, despite its relative ease compared to traditional curved piecing, this technique is best attempted by the more experienced quilter. The author also provides extensive discussions of free-motion stitching, finding design inspiration, working with color, and making templates, so intrepid souls can invent graceful curved-line quilts of their own. <i>--Amy Handy</i><p><b>Vikki Pignatelli</b> is an award winning quilter, quilt designer, and instructor.

This story of heroic endeavour won Hemingway the Nobel Prize for Literature. It stands as a unique and timeless vision of the beauty and grief of man&#39;s challenge to the elements.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: "The old man was dreaming about the lions." Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. <i>--James Marcus</i>2 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Morality: An Introduction to Ethics</h2><p>Bernard Williams&#39;s remarkable essay on morality confronts the problems of writing moral philosophy, and offers a stimulating alternative to more systematic accounts that seem nevertheless to have left all the important issues somewhere off the page.

Peter Evans questions such simplistic views, offering a new vision of why state involvement works in some cases and produces disasters in others. To illustrate, he looks at how state agencies, local entrepreneurs, and transnational corporations shaped the emergence of computer industries in Brazil, India, and Korea during the seventies and eighties.</p><br><p> Evans starts with the idea that states vary in the way they are organized and tied to society. In some nations, like Zaire, the state is predatory, ruthlessly extracting and providing nothing of value in return. In others, like Korea, it is developmental, promoting industrial transformation. In still others, like Brazil and India, it is in between, sometimes helping, sometimes hindering. Evans's years of comparative research on the successes and failures of state involvement in the process of industrialization have here been crafted into a persuasive and entertaining work, which demonstrates that successful state action requires an understanding of its own limits, a realistic relationship to the global economy, and the combination of coherent internal organization and close links to society that Evans called "embedded autonomy."</p></p><p><p>"`What kinds of state structure facilitate industrial transformation?' To answer this apparently simple question, Evans takes us on a tour d'horizon of state theory, bureaucratic theory, and development theory, then on to a close-up look at the computer industry in Korea, Brazil, and India. His answer combines big theory with a grasp of the texture of particular societies, organizations, and individuals. A blockbuster, in every sense."<b>--Robert Wade, Institute of Development Studies, Sussex University</b></p><p>"Among the many studies of the state's role in promoting social and economic progress, Peter Evans's new book stands out for its theoretical and historical depth, for its wealth of institutional and technical data, and above all for its ability to recognize and acknowledge complexity. Between the polar opposites of the `developmental' and the `predatory' state, Evans inserts a rich variety of intermediate and frequently shifting configurations. In a masterful survey of the computer industries in Brazil, India, and Korea, he convinces the reader that the more successful policies have resulted from implausible and surprising institutional innovations that were far removed from available ideological recipes. A major and mature accomplishment."<b>--Albert O. Hirschman, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton</b></p><p>"A major accomplishment. Evans interprets the state's role in economic development on the basis of solid empirical research and an innovative framework that `brings the state back in' while keeping it at bay from interest groups."<b>--Alice H. Amsden, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"<i>Embedded Autonomy</i> is a wonderful tale of triumph and debacle that paints the big picture as well as the dramatic detail. It will have a major impact in the academy because of its solid basis in Evans's careful research on development projects and its deft critique of state-bashing. It will likely also find a large audience in the applied development community in the United States and abroad."<b>--Christopher Chase-Dunn, The Johns Hopkins University</b></p><b>Peter Evans</b>, Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of <i>Dependent Development: The Alliance of Multinational State and Local Capital in Brazil</i> (Princeton).</p><h2>Made in North Korea: Graphics from Everyday Life in the DPRK</h2><p><p><b>North Korea uncensored and unfiltered &#x2013; ordinary life in the world's most secretive nation, captured in never-before-seen ephemera.</b></p><p><em>Made in North Korea</em> uncovers the fascinating and surprisingly beautiful graphic culture of North Korea - from packaging to hotel brochures, luggage tags to tickets for the world-famous mass games.

Lawrence's last novel is one of the major works of fiction of the twentieth century. Filled with scenes of intimate beauty, explores the emotions of a lonely woman trapped in a sterile marriage and her growing love for the robust gamekeeper of her husband's estate. The most controversial of Lawrence's books, <b>Lady Chatterly's Lover</b> joyously affirms the author's vision of individual regeneration through sexual love.

Readers will learn to develop a simple method of Bible interpretation and to assess the impact of <i>Left Behind</i> on the future of the church and our society.</p></p><p>With the phenomenal success of the Left Behind apocalyptic fiction series, it's inevitable that critiques will follow. DeMar, the author of 16 books, including two on biblical prophecy, challenges the theological premise that underlies the popular novels about end times and the return of Christ. While admitting that Left Behind coauthor Tim LaHaye's sincerity about the evangelistic impact of the novels is unquestionable, DeMar asserts that not only is Left Behind a work of fiction, but the "theological premise upon which it is based is also a work of fiction." As he constructs his case, DeMar strives to make the information accessible to a lay audience by incorporating scenes from the Left Behind series, snippets from popular movies such as You've Got Mail and dialogue lifted from his own radio show scripts. Unfortunately, a thick jungle of prophetic references and Scripture notations soon tangles the average reader into knots. The last section, entitled "What difference does it make?," finds DeMar unconvincing. Readers interested in biblical prophecy might be absorbed by DeMar's case against LaHaye's theology, and critics of the popular series may appreciate DeMar for offering a different perspective on the New Testament book of Revelation. However, fans of the Left Behind series who have wondered about the novels' theology and are looking for a clear, persuasive read will likely put this down after the first few pages. (Oct.)Forecast: Desecration, the ninth novel in the Left Behind series, has a pub date of October 30; this critique is shrewdly timed to release on the very same day. Expect the renewed hype for the Left Behind series to help spur sales of this rather lackluster rebuttal.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>PSYCH</h2><p>PSYCH 4 maximizes students&#39; effort and engagement by empowering them to direct their own learning, through a single, affordable course solution.

His health rapidly deteriorating, Crews told Geltner he was on board and would even sit for interviews and tell his stories one last time. &#x201c;Ask me anything you want, bud,&#x201d; Crews said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;d better do it quick.&#x201d;</p><p>The result is <i>Blood, Bone, and Marrow</i>, the first full-length biography of one of the most unlikely figures in twentieth-century American literature, a writer who emerged from a dirt-poor South Georgia tenant farm and went on to create a singularly unique voice of fiction. With books such as <i>Scar Lover</i>, <i>Body</i>, and <i>Naked in Garden Hills,</i> Crews opened a new window into southern life, focusing his lenson the poor and disenfranchised, the people who skinned the hogs and tended the fields, the &#x201c;grits,&#x201d; as Crews affectionately called his characters and himself. He lived by a code of his own design, flouting authority and baring his soul, and the stories of his whiskey-and-blood-soaked lifestyle created a myth to match any of his fictional creations. His outlaw life, his distinctive voice and the context in which he lived combine to form the elements of a singularly compelling narrative about an underappreciated literary treasure.</p></p><p>The first biography of Harry Crews, writer of the&#x201c;Dirty South&#x201d; and wildman extraordinaireTED GELTNER is an associate professor of journalism at Valdosta State University, adviser to the campus newspaper, and author of <i>Last King of the Sports Page: The Life and Career of Jim Murray</i>.

This period saw the publication of his major works: <i>A Thousand Plateaus </i>(1980), <i>Cinema I: Image-Movement </i>(1983), <i>Cinema II: Image-Time </i>(1985), all leading through language, concept and art to<i> What is Philosophy?</i> (1991). <i>Two Regimes of Madness </i>also documents Deleuze's increasing involvement with politics (with Toni Negri, for example, the Italian philosopher and professor accused of associating with the Red Brigades). Both volumes were conceived by the author himself and will be his last. Michel Foucault famously wrote: &#x201c;One day, perhaps, this century will be Deleuzian.&#x201d; This book provides a prodigious entry into the work of the most important philosopher of our time.

In the urban sprawl between Athens and Piraeus, the narratives roam restlessly through the impoverished working-class quarters located off the tourist routes. Everyone is dreaming of escape: to the mountains, to an island or a palatial estate, into a Hans Christian Andersen story world. What are they fleeing? The old woes--gossip, watchful neighbors, the oppression and indifference of the rich--now made infinitely worse. In Ikonomou&#39;s concrete streets, the rain is always looming, the politicians&#39; slogans are ignored, and the police remain a violent, threatening presence offstage. Yet even at the edge of destitution, his men and women act for themselves, trying to preserve what little solidarity remains in a deeply atomized society, and in one way or another finding their own voice. There is faith here, deep faith--though little or none in those who habitually ask for it.</p><p>Christos Ikonomou was born in Athens in 1970. He has published two collections of short stories, <i>The Woman on the Rails</i> (2003), and <i>Something will Happen, You'll See</i> (2010). <i>Something Will Happen, You'll See</i> won the prestigious Best Short-Story Collection State Award and became the most reviewed Greek book of 2011.&nbsp;<br><b>About the Translator: </b><br>Karen Emmerich's translations from the Greek include books by Margarita Karapanou, Amanda Michalopoulou, Ersi Sotiropoulos, and Vassilis Vassilikos. Her translation of&nbsp;Miltos Sachtouris for Archipelago was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in Poetry, and her translation of Yannis Ritsos's <i>Diaries of Exile</i> with Edmund Keeley won the 2014 PEN Literary Award. She has received translation grants and awards from PEN, the NEH, and the Modern Greek Studies Association. She teaches at the University of Oregon."In Ikonomou&#x2019;s timely novel, the human fallout of the Greek economic recession is writ large. . . .&nbsp;Concerned with the bottom rungs of the social ladder, [these] pieces . . .&nbsp; cover an astonishing range. . . .&nbsp;These stories add up to a panorama of the human spirit under siege and a searing indictment of the failures to reform the Greek infrastructure." <b>--&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"[Ikonomou's] characters might feel like they are suffering private tragedies, but SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN repeatedly calls our attention to the subtle human connections that remain. . . .

He realizes that the mind plays games when faced with something it can&#x2019;t bear to see. Ikonomou forces it, and us, to look. These stories give back to the world what is lost in the TV rendition of a country&#x2019;s suffering. These fictions are the news, writ atomically, or cellularly, character by character, progressing one gesture and emotional tick at a time. The loss of the individuals behind any news story is a crime.

Jacob van Ruisdael first depicted them as a precocious teenager and continued to represent all types in various settings until his very last years. Water mills, in contrast, were scarce in the new Dutch Republic, found mainly in the eastern provinces, particularly near the border with Germany. Ruisdael discovered them in the early 1650s and was the first artist to make water mills the principal subject of a landscape.</p><p>His most celebrated painting, <i>Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede</i> at the Rijksmuseum, and the J. Paul Getty Museum&#x2019;s <i>Two Undershot Water Mills with an Open Sluice</i> are the centerpieces of this overview of the artist&#x2019;s depictions of windmills and water mills. Both depended upon forces of nature for their operation, but their use in the Netherlands and their place in seventeenth-century Dutch art differed considerably. This book examines their role in Holland and introduces readers to the pleasure of studying Ruisdael&#x2019;s images of them, a joy conveyed by the English landscapist John Constable in a letter written to his dearest friend after seeing a Ruisdael painting of a water mill in a London shop: &#x201c;It haunts my mind and clings to my heart.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Seymour Slive is Gleason Professor of Fine Arts Emeritus at Harvard University and former Director of the Harvard University Art Museums.

While McCullagh and Nelder&#39;s Generalized Linear Models shows how to extend the usual linear methodology to cover analysis of a range of data types, Generalized Additive Models enhances this methodology even further by incorporating the flexibility of nonparametric regression. Clear prose, exercises in each chapter, and case studies enhance this popular text.</p><p>&#34;That the authors succeed in conveying their message is largely due to the extremely clear and effective organization of the text. General concepts are introduced, illustrated with relatively simple applications, and then re-examined at a more theoretical level.&#34; -Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C &#34;This book aims to &#39;provide an up-to-date survey of current research in additive modelling, &#39; with the &#39;emphasis on practical rather than theoretical.&#39; With that in mind, the book does extremely well.&#34; -Statistics in Medicine &#34;Generalized Additive Models is a good starting point for researchers wishing to initiate themselves in the vast and burgeoning area of large-sample nonparametric model fitting.&#34; -Journal of the American Statistical Association &#34;Overall, my impressions of this book are very favorable, and I consider it a book worth owning... The material is presented clearly and attractively. I recommend it to anyone interested in or needing to use extensions to the general linear model.&#34; -Technometrics ..&#34;. a complete introduction to the topic in a single monograph... a very readable book that provides the reader with great insight into a vast array of data analysis techniques... an excellent text for a course on smoothing-based analysis techniques... highly recommended to any reader interested in an introduction to many of the recent developments in data analysis.&#34; -Siam Review</p><h2>Digital Planet: Tomorrow&#39;s Technology and You, Complete (Computers Are Your Future)</h2><p><p>Completely updated, <b> <i>Tomorrow&#x2019;s Technology and You, </i> </b>provides you with an understanding of information technology so you can successfully navigate change and advance into the future. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today we&#x2019;re standing at the junction of three powerful and rapidly evolving technological forces: computers, communications, and digital entertainment.

Alice Walker, Maxine Hong Kingston, Charles Johnson, Thich Nhat Hanh, and twenty-five other contributors share their unique perspectives on the fundamental Buddhist concepts of suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering. Together they represent the entire spectrum of Buddhist tradition.<br><br>Thought-provoking and passionate, <i>Dharma, Color, and Culture</i> forges a new path in our understanding of the simple truths of Buddhism and their relevance for all of us. Essays by Latino, Asian, African-American, and Native American Buddhist practitioners, lay people, and Dharma teachers address the connection between diversity, racism, and Buddhism at four levels: the personal, the interpersonal, the institutional, and the cultural. Recognizing that attention to the pain of racism is essential, the overarching theme of this work is how the Dharma becomes an effective antidote to the suffering and a vehicle for healing and liberation.<br></p><p>Baldoqu�n, a Soto Zen priest, amasses a collection of writings by "people of color," primarily American writers of African, Asian, Latino and Native American heritages, who share their experiences with and perspectives on traditional Buddhist teachings. Each of the book's first four sections devote several essays to one of the Four Noble Truths, and a final section explores how some of the writers have "integrated" the teachings "into the realities of their lives." The writers engage the issue of color vis-�-vis Buddhist teachings in different ways and to varying degrees. Some reflect primarily on the power the teachings have to bring personal healing after experiences of dehumanization and violence. Others use Buddhism as a method for recognizing and engaging the historical and political roots of racism and its manifest suffering. Still others, such as Maxine Hong Kingston, all but entirely sublimate issues of color in favor of exploring a tragedy anyone might face&#x2014;losing a precious item in a fire, for instance. The essays are uneven in their effectiveness. Many are clear, focused and elucidate the topic at hand,but others (including the editor's own) wander off topic, leaving the reader puzzled. While the collection offers welcome voices and challenging perspectives, its loose, patchy approach prevents it from becoming a genuinely compelling, cohesive anthology. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Sixth Edition offers improved conceptual coverage and added content to bridge the gap between concepts and actual implementations. Threads has been added to this latest edition and includes coverage of Pthreads and Java threads. All code examples have been rewritten and are now in C. Increased coverage of small footprint operating systems such as PalmOS and real-time operating system, as well as a new chapter on Windows 2000, have been added.<br> Market: Computer Scientists; Programmers.</p><p>Operating systems are large and complex, and yet must function with near-absolute reliability--that's why they're a class unto themselves in the field of software development. Since its first release 20 years ago, "the dinosaur book"--<i>Operating System Concepts</i> by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne--has been a valuable reference for designers and implementers of operating systems. The newly released sixth edition of this book maintains the volume's authority with new sections on thread management, distributed processes, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). There's also information on the workings of the latest crop of operating systems, including Microsoft Windows 2000, Linux, FreeBSD, and compact operating systems for handheld devices.<p>This book is concerned with the design of operating systems, which is to say it enumerates the problems that pop up in the creation of efficient systems and explores alternative ways of dealing with them, detailing the advantages and shortcomings of each. For example, in their chapter on scheduling CPU activity, the authors explain several algorithms (first-come, first-served, and round-robin scheduling, among others) for allocating the capacity of single and multiple processors among jobs. They highlight the relative advantages of each, and explain how several real-life operating systems solve the problem. They then present the reader with exercises (this book is essentially a university textbook) that inspire thought and discussion. <i>--David Wall</i> </p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> The problems faced by designers of system software for electronic computers, and strategies that have been developed over the past 20 years to address (and, in some cases, solve) them. Problems of CPU scheduling, memory allocation, paging, processes and threads, storage management, distributed processes and storage mechanisms, and security are all discussed thoroughly and with many authoritative references.</p>For the past two decades, dinosaurs have roamed the cover of Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne's <b>OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS</b>. The product of a long process of evolutionary adaptations, this best-selling text has continually evolved to address the latest trends in operating system design. With its strong emphasis on underlying concepts and rich selection of examples and case studies, no other text provides such a solid theoretical foundation for understanding operating systems. <p>Now in a fully revised and updated Sixth Edition, <b>OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS</b> offers new chapters on Threads and Windows 2000, as well as new and expanded coverage of the client-server model and NFS, small footprint operating systems for PDAs, real-time operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, distributed operating systems, and more.</p></p><h2>How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby</h2><p>In this new edition, Dr. Shettles provides updates on the support of the Shettles method and information on competing methods.

His competitor for the prize, Britain's Robert Scott, arrived one month later--but died on the return with four of his men only 11 miles from their next cache of supplies. But it was Scott, ironically, who became the legend, Britain's heroic failure, "a monument to sheer ambition and bull-headed persistence. His achievement was to perpetuate the romantic myth of the explorer as martyr, and ... to glorify suffering and self-sacrifice as ends in themselves." The world promptly forgot about Amundsen.<p> Biographer Ronald Huntford's attempt to restore Amundsen to glory, first published in 1979 under the title <i>Scott and Amundsen</i>, has been thawed as part of the Modern Library Exploration series, captained by Jon Krakauer (of <i>Into Thin Air</i> fame). <i>The Last Place on Earth</i> is a complex and fascinating account of the race for this last great terrestrial goal, and it's pointedly geared toward demythologizing Scott. Though this was the age of the amateur explorer, Amundsen was a professional: he left little to chance, apprenticed with Eskimos, and obsessed over every detail. While Scott clung fast to the British rule of "No skis, no dogs," Amundsen understood that both were vital to survival, and they clearly won him the Pole. </p><p> Amundsen in Huntford's view is the "last great Viking" and Scott his bungling opposite: "stupid ... recklessly incompetent," and irresponsible in the extreme--failings that cost him and his teammates their lives. Yet for all of Scott's real or exaggerated faults, he understood far better than Amundsen the power of a well-crafted sentence. Scott's diaries were recovered and widely published, and if the world insisted on lionizing Scott, it was partly because he told a better story. Huntford's bias aside, it's clear that both Scott and Amundsen were valiant and deeply flawed. "Scott ... had set out to be an heroic example. Amundsen merely wanted to be first at the pole. Both had their prayers answered." <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p>"A remarkably vivid picture of the agonies and feuds, as well as joys,<br>of polar exploration . . . a fascinating book."--The New York Times<br><br>"An extraordinarily rich reading experience."--Los Angeles Times<br><br>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the South Pole was the most coveted prize in the fiercely nationalistic modern age of exploration. In this brilliant dual biography, the award-winning writer Roland Huntford reexamines every detail of the great race to the South Pole between Britain's Robert Scott and Norway's Roald Amundsen. Scott, who died along with four of his men only eleven miles from his next cache of supplies, became Britain's beloved failure, while Amundsen, who not only beat Scott to the Pole but returned alive, was largely forgotten. This account of their race is a gripping, highly readable history that captures the driving ambitions of the era and the complex, often deeply flawed men who were charged with carrying them out.<br><br>The Last Place on Earth is the first of Huntford's masterly trilogy of polar biographies. It is also the only work on the subject in the English language based on the original Norwegian sources, to which Huntford returned to revise and update this edition.<br><br>Roland Huntford is the former Scandinavian correspondent for the London Observer.

Ted Dintersmith's journey shows us where corporate reformers got lost and points to our constant educational true north: trust, relevance, discovery, joy, and, above all, a purpose that has nothing to do with a test score and everything to do with developing the infinite potential of the creative, critical mind and the compassionate, ethical character. Every person needs to read this wonderful and important book."<b>--Lily Eskelsen Garcia, President of the National Education Association</b></p><p>"Dintersmith knows how to turn a road trip into an education--his own and ours. He also knows how to tell a story, to hook you with each tale of children enthusiastically engaged in meaningful, motivated learning.

A must-read for anyone who cares about our children and the future of our nation."<b>--Linda Darling-Hammond, President and CEO of the Learning Policy Institute</b></p><p>"All children love to learn, but they don't all get on with school. The problem isn't the children: it's how we do school. As Ted Dintersmith shows in this landmark book, it's not only possible to reimagine education, it's vital that we do. Too often schools are snagged in a corrosive web of tangled regulations, political agendas, outmoded institutional habits, and a repressive culture of standardized testing. But there's hope. In among the undergrowth, there's an emergent counterculture of inspirational schools that are rising to the real challenges of educating young people for life in the twenty-first century. <i>What School Could Be</i> is both a vivid account of this grassroots revolution and a hardheaded analysis of its desperate significance. Above all it is a passionate manifesto for forms of education that do justice to the deep talents and diverse futures of all our children.

These collections provide a rich resource for the study of African American art, yet many also possess a diverse array of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American art. <i>To Conserve a Legacy</i> documents an outstanding sampling of paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, and sculptures owned by Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University, North Carolina Central University, and Tuskegee University.This book serves as the catalog for a major exhibition and conservation project organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art and The Studio Museum in Harlem, in association with the Williamstown Art Conservation Center and the six participating HBCUs. The book contains a profile of each university collection, color reproductions of many artworks included in the exhibition, biographical information on all the represented artists, and documentation of the conservation and care practices helping to preserve the art for future generations.</p><p>Two major essays place the HBCU art collections and this collaborative project in a historical context and develop six themes around which the exhibition was organized: Forever Free: Emancipation Visualized; The First Americans; Training the Head, the Hand, and the Heart; The American Portrait Gallery; American Expressionism; and Modern Lives, Modern Impulses. The artists include Romare Bearden, John Biggers, Elizabeth Catlett, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, William H. Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Edmonia Lewis, Archibald Motley, Georgia O'Keeffe, Horace Pippin, P. H. Polk, Alfred Stieglitz, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Doris Ulmann, Carl Van Vechten, Thomas Waterman, James Weeks, Charles White, and many others. The book also contains forty-two entry essays by American scholars on many of the individual artworks. The exhibition was co-curated by Richard Powell, Chairman of the Art and Art History Department at Duke University, and Jock Reynolds, Director of the Yale University Art Gallery.</p></p><p>Richard Powell, Chairman of the Art and Art History Department at Duke University.The works in this companion to a traveling exhibition are drawn from collections of American art held by six of the oldest, most prestigious historically black universities (Clark Atlanta, Fisk, Hampton, Howard, North Carolina Central, and Tuskegee). The exhibition proclaims the importance of these hitherto little-known collections, which consist primarily of works by major and minor 19th- and 20th-century African American artists, as well as such well-known modernists as Hartley and O'Keeffe. The text consists of an anthology of essays that discuss the development of the exhibition, the history of the collections, and related conservation issues. Following is an alphabetically arranged biographical catalog of artists featured in the exhibition. The scholarly tone of much of the writing and the emphasis on academic issues will make this somewhat challenging for the general public, but this important book brings to light notable collections that deserve more attention.

But the essays of Julia Kristeva in this volume, though they often deal with literature and art, do not amount to either "literary criticism" or "art criticism." Their concern, writes Kristeva, "remains intratheoretical: they are based on art and literature in order to subvert the very theoretical, philosophical, or semiological apparatus."</p><p>Probing beyond the discoveries of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Roman Jakobson and others, Julia Kristeva proposes and tests theories centered on the nature and development of the novel, and on what she has defined as a signifying practice in poetic language and pictural works. <i>Desire in Language</i> fully shows what Roman Jakobson has called Kristeva's "genuine gift of questioning generally adopted 'axioms,' and her contrary gift of releasing various 'damned questions' from their traditional question marks."</p></p><p>Julia Kristeva, internationally known psychoanalyst and critic, is Professor of Linguistics at the University de Paris VII. She has hosted a French television series and is the author of many critically acclaimed books published by Columbia University Press in translation, including <i>Time and Sense: Proust and the Experience of Literature</i> and the novel, <i>Possessions.</i>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Sex and Social Justice</h2><p>What does it mean to respect the dignity of a human being? What sort of support do human capacities demand from the world, and how should we think about this support when we encounter differences of gender or sexuality? How should we think about each other across divisions that a legacy of injustice has created? In <em>Sex and Social Justice</em>, Martha Nussbaum delves into these questions and emerges with a distinctive conception of feminism that links feminist inquiry closely to the important progress that has been made during the past few decades in articulating theories of both national and global justice.<br><br>Growing out of Nussbaum's years of work with an international development agency connected with the United Nations, this collection charts a feminism that is deeply concerned with the urgent needs of women who live in hunger and illiteracy, or under unequal legal systems. Offering an internationalism informed by development economics and empirical detail, many essays take their start from the experiences of women in developing countries. Nussbaum argues for a universal account of human capacity and need, while emphasizing the essential role of knowledge of local circumstance. Further chapters take on the pursuit of social justice in the sexual sphere, exploring the issue of equal rights for lesbians and gay men.<br><br>Nussbaum's arguments are shaped by her work on Aristotle and the Stoics and by the modern liberal thinkers Kant and Mill. She contends that the liberal tradition of political thought holds rich resources for addressing violations of human dignity on the grounds of sex or sexuality, provided the tradition transforms itself by responsiveness to arguments concerning the social shaping of preferences and desires. She challenges liberalism to extend its tradition of equal concern to women, always keeping both agency and choice as goals. With great perception, she combines her radical feminist critique of sex relations with an interest in the possibilities of trust, sympathy, and understanding.<br><br><em>Sex and Social Justice</em> will interest a wide readership because of the public importance of the topics Nussbaum addresses and the generous insight she shows in dealing with these issues. Brought together for this timely collection, these essays, extensively revised where previously published, offer incisive political reflections by one of our most important living philosophers.<br></p><p><i>"Human beings have a dignity that deserves respect from laws and social institutions. This idea has many origins in many traditions; by now it is at the core of modern liberal democratic thought and practice all over the world. The idea of human dignity is usually taken to involve an idea of</i> equal <i>worth: rich and poor, rural and urban, female and male, all are equally deserving of respect, just in virtue of being human, and this respect should not be abridged on account of a characteristic that is distributed by the whims of fortune."</i><p> But in the world we live in, notes classicist and law professor Martha C. Nussbaum, gender and sexual orientation are used routinely as excuses to violate human dignity. In 15 deftly written essays that are as accessible as they are erudite, she makes a convincing argument for viewing feminism and gay-rights activism as two facets of the same movement, a movement that has legitimate roots in the writings of philosophers like Kant and Mill (as well as the ancient Greeks). Whether she's discussing issues as concrete as Colorado's attempts to pass legislation that discriminated against homosexuals and the contemporary debate over female genital mutilation, or as abstract as the social construction of desire, Nussbaum writes with a thoroughness and clarity that help the reader better to imagine a society in which true equality for <i>all</i> people could be achieved. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><br>Martha Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago.

From Hungary to Germany to the United States, they remained friends and continued to work together and influence each other throughout their lives. As a result, their work was integral to some of the most important scientific and political developments of the twentieth century.<br><br>They were an extraordinary group of talents: Wigner won a Nobel Prize in theoretical physics; Szilard was the first to see that a chain reaction based on neutrons was possible, initiated the Manhattan Project, but left physics to try to restrict nuclear arms; von Neumann could solve difficult problems in his head and developed the modern computer for more complex problems; von K�rm�n became the first director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, providing the scientific basis for the U.S. Air Force; and Teller was the father of the hydrogen bomb, whose name is now synonymous with the controversial "Star Wars" initiative of the 1980s. Each was fiercely opinionated, politically active, and fought against all forms of totalitarianism. <br><br>Istv�n Hargittai, as a young Hungarian physical chemist, was able to get to know some of these great men in their later years, and the depth of information and human interest in <em>The Martians of Science</em> is the result of his personal relationships with the subjects, their families, and their contemporaries.<br></p><p><br><strong>Istv�n Hargittai</strong> is Professor of Chemistry and head of the George A.

Five brilliant Jewish-Hungarian kids burst out of the great secondary schools of Hungary, learn their physics in Germany, and give their all to America in WWII. And after. <br>Across the ethnic quilt of Europe and America, the five brilliant "Martians" of this book roam, their weapon in mind --math!

When the Bible speaks of God, the name used holds more significance than you ever knew. For example, the very first reference to God in Genesis 1:1&#x2014;the name Elohim&#x2014;teaches and reveals the triune nature of God.We are commanded to honor the name of God, but to do that adequately, we must understand the inherit greatness of the names which God uses to refer to himself. Ken Hemphill takes the reader through an in-depth devotional study of the names of God, teaching the significance of each name and the keys it possesses to growing us in relationship with God.

Thus, without the use of higher mathematics, he demonstrates the application of probability to games of chance, physics, reliability. of witnesses, astronomy, insurance, democratic government and many other areas.<br>General readers will find it an exhilarating experience to follow Laplace's nontechnical application of mathematical techniques to the appraisal, solution and/or prediction of the outcome of many types of problems.

For Mary Rose O'Reilley it was a question that would not go away; <i>The Peaceable Classroom</i> records one attempt to answer it. Out of her own experience, primarily as a college English teacher, she writes about certain moral connections between school and the outside world, making clear that the kind of environment created in the classroom determines a whole series of choices students make in the future, especially about issues of peace and justice. </p> <p>Animated throughout by the spirit of the personal essayist, <i>The Peaceable Classroom</i> first defines a pedagogy of nonviolence and then analyzes certain contemporary approaches to rhetoric and literary studies in light of nonviolent theory. The pedagogy of Ken Macrorie, Peter Elbow, and the National Writing Project is examined. The author emphasizes that many techniques taken for granted in contemporary writing pedagogy -- such as freewriting and journaling -- are not just educational fads, but rather ways of shaping a different human being. "Finding voice," then, is not only an aspect of writing process, but a spiritual event as well. To find voice, and to mediate personal voice in a community of others, is one of the central dialectics of the peaceable classroom. </p> <p>The author urges teachers to foster critical encounters with the intellectual and spiritual traditions of humankind and to reclaim the revolutionary power of literature to change things. </p></p><p><p>Mary Rose O'Reilley teaches English at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Eagleton has added a new preface to this anniversary edition to address more recent developments in literary studies, including what he describes as &#34;the growth of a kind of anti-theory&#34;, and the idea that literary theory has been institutionalized.

However, the importance of his houses has been largely overlooked. This beautiful book is the first to look at Kahn&#x2019;s nine major private houses. Beginning with his earliest encounters with Modernism in the late 1920s and continuing through his iconic work of the 1960s and 1970s, the authors trace the evolution of the architect&#x2019;s thinking, which began and matured through his design of houses and their interiors, a process inspired by his interactions with clients and his admiration for vernacular building traditions.</p><p>Richly illustrated with new and period photographs and original drawings, as well as previously unpublished materials from personal interviews, archives, and Kahn&#x2019;s own writings, <i>The Houses of Louis Kahn</i> shows how his ideas about domestic spaces challenged conventions, much like his major public commissions, and were developed into one of the most remarkable expressions of the American house.</p></p><p><p><b>George H.

These oral histories offer new versions--from Warm Springs, Chiricahua, Mescalero, and Lipan Apache--of events previously known only through descriptions left by non-Indians.</p><p>A high school and college teacher, Ball moved to Ruidoso, New Mexico, in 1942. Her house on the edge of the Mescalero Apache Reservation was a stopping-off place for Apaches on the dusty walk into town. She quickly realized she was talking to the sons and daughters of Geronimo, Cochise, Victorio, and their warriors. After winning their confidence, Ball would ultimately interview sixty-seven people.</p><p>Here is the Apache side of the story as told to Eve Ball. Including accounts of Victorio's sister Lozen, a warrior and medicine woman who was the only unmarried woman allowed to ride with the men, as well as unflattering portrayals of Geronimo's actions while under attack, and Mescalero scorn for the horse thief Billy the Kid, this volume represents a significant new source on Apache history and lifeways.</p></p><p>These oral histories recounted by Apache elders to historian Eve Ball during the 1940s and 50s offer new versions of events previously known only through descriptions left by non-Indians.Sherry Robinson is a journalist and freelance writer living in Albuquerque.</p><h2>Machining Fundamentals: From Basic to Advanced Techniques</h2><p>Provides an introduction to this area of manufacturing technology explaining the how, why, and when of numerous machining operations, set-ups and procedures.

Their intersecting lives and involvement in espionage create an uncommon structure for John le Carr�'s timely and provocative new novel. The first two-thirds of the flashback-laden plot focuses mostly on Mundy, his seedy life as cashiered double agent/current tour guide in a Bavarian castle and his past adventures with Sasha. The last third of the book concerns a scheme that the revolutionary Sasha ("I have the Lutheran curse. Conviction without action has no meaning.") presents to Mundy to undermine the American/British incursion in Iraq with the backing of a mysterious philanthropist. John Lee handles the many characters and accents well; he is at his best in pacing the book so that the listener enjoys complete clarity about the timeframe of the shifting events. Lee also excels in the dramatic final scenes.

It is often assigned by college and high school reading and writing classes, especially when our President wants us to go out and kill somebody. Slaughterhouse-Five came out in 1969 near the height of the War in Vietnam. At that time, our President told us the Vietnam War was a war we had to fight to protect the freedom loving people of South Vietnam from being overwhelmed by the Communist North. We lost that war. Kurt Vonnegut's long awaited war novel proved to be a miracle of compression. It is a contemporary Pilgram's Progress with a hero named curiously enough Billy Pilgrim. He is the son of an American barber. He serves as a chaplain's assistant in the Second World War, is captured by the Germans, survives the largest massacre in European history, the fire bombing of Dresden. (Vonnegut, too, was a prisoner of war and saw that fire storm.) Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist after the war, makes a great deal of money, is kidnapped by a flying saucer from the planet Tralfamadore on his daughter's wedding night. He is mated in a public zoo on that planet &#x2013; to a star of many Earthling blue movies, the gorgeous Montana Wildhack. And so on. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. speaks to the younger generation. Once mistakenly typed as a science-fiction writer, he is now recognized as a main-stream story teller often fascinated by the magic and comic possibilities of the magazines. His books are widely used in college courses and the groundswell of his present popularity began on college campuses where he was in great demand as a speaker.</p></p><p>Mr. Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis Indiana, in 1922 and attended Cornell University, Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Universities of Tennessee and Chicago. His novels include Player Piano and 14 other books and numerous magazine articles. Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was an American writer. In a career spanning over 50 years, Vonnegut published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction, with further collections being published after his death. He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969). He was born November 11, 1922 in Indianapolis Indiana. Vonnegut attended Cornell University but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of Tennessee. On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave to visit his mother for mother&#39;s day, only to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous day. Vonnegut was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. I first became aware of Kurt Vonnegut when I was a kid and read an article by him in Colliers Magazine about a trip to Mars.

Reprint.</p><p>This is a full cast production with sound effects and original music produced at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. <p>Length is approximately 2 hours.</p><p>One of the most durable myths in Western culture, the story of Faust tells of a learned German doctor who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power. Early enactments of Faust's damnation were often the raffish fare of clowns and low comedians. But the young Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe (1564&#x2013;1593) recognized in the story of Faust's temptation and fall the elements of tragedy.<br>In his epic treatment of the Faust legend, Marlowe retains much of the rich phantasmagoria of its origins. There are florid visions of an enraged Lucifer, dueling angels, the Seven Deadly Sins, Faustus tormenting the Pope, and his summoning of the spirit of Alexander the Great. But the playwright created equally powerful scenes that invest the work with tragic dignity, among them the doomed man's calling upon Christ to save him and his ultimate rejection of salvation for the embrace of Helen of Troy.</p><p></p></p><h2>Savage Anxieties: The Invention of Western Civilization</h2><p><p>From one of the world's leading experts on Native American law and indigenous peoples' human rights comes an original and striking intellectual history of the tribe and Western civilization that sheds new light on how we understand ourselves and our contemporary society. Throughout the centuries, conquest, war, and unspeakable acts of violence and dispossession have all been justified by citing civilization's opposition to these differences represented by the tribe. Robert Williams, award winning author, legal scholar, and member of the Lumbee Indian Tribe, proposes a wide-ranging reexamination of the history of the Western world, told from the perspective of civilization's war on tribalism as a way of life. Williams shows us how what we thought we knew about the rise of Western civilization over the tribe is in dire need of reappraisal.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert A. Williams, Jr.</b> is a member of the Lumbee Indian Tribe as well as the professor of law and director of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the University of Arizona. He is the author of the classic work on Indian rights under US law, <i>The American Indian in Western Legal Thought,</i> which won the Gustavus Meyer human rights award recently. The recipient of awards from the MacArthur, Ford, and Soros foundations, Williams is also well known for his work defending tribal groups before the United Nations and the Supreme Court.</p>&#x201c;Armed with guns, horses, and machines, European settlers relentlessly mowed down, pushed aside, and in some cases enslaved peaceful natives they found living in the new worlds they were overrunning. Reaching back to antiquity, they resurrected myths about one-eyed giants and other monsters to rationalize the harsh treatment they were visiting on Indians and Mexicans. Later, they would deploy very similar rhetorical strategies to justify extermination and enslavement in other parts of the world. The suspicion grows that Western agents are the savages and the peace-loving natives the superior race. <i>Savage Anxieties</i> explains how, like bad money driving out good, a savage society will win every time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Delgado, professor, Seattle University School of Law and author of Critical Race Theory</i></p><h2>A Journey to Freedom: Richard Oakes, Alcatraz, and the Red Power Movement (The Henry Roe Cloud Series on American Indians and Modernity)</h2><p>The first book-length biography of Richard Oakes, a Red Power activist of the 1960s who was a leader in the Alcatraz takeover and the Indigenous rights movement<br> &nbsp;<br> A revealing portrait of Richard Oakes, the brilliant, charismatic Native American leader who was instrumental in the takeovers of Alcatraz, Fort Lawton, and Pit River and whose assassination in 1972 galvanized the Trail of Broken Treaties march on Washington, D.C.

Its vision of a culture stifled by materialistic values emerges not just through its central narratives, but through its apparently incidental characters and scenes. The chief of its several plots centres on John Harmon who returns to England as his father&#39;s heir. He is believed drowned under suspicious circumstances - a situation convenient to his wish for anonymity until he can evaluate Bella Wilfer whom he must marry to secure his inheritance. The story is filled with colourful characters and incidents - the faded aristocrats and parvenus gathered at the Veneering&#39;s dinner table, Betty Higden and her terror of the workhouse and the greedy plottings of Silas Wegg.</p><p><i>Our Mutual Friend</i> was the last novel Charles Dickens completed and is, arguably, his darkest and most complex. The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, &#34;Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#39;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#34;Noddy&#34; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#34;the Golden Dustman.&#34; Charles Dickens&#39;s last complete novel, &#34;Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, &#34;Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens&#39;s most complex--and satisfying--novels.</p><h2>Peterson's Principles Of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery, Third Edition - 2 Vol. Set (Hb)</h2><p>Peterson&#39;s Principles of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery third edition, encompasses a wide range of diverse topics making it a unique text amongst the medical and dental specialties.

Curious Alice, the bossy White Rabbit, the formidable Queen of Hearts, and the Mad Hatter are among the best-loved, most iconic literary creations of all time. <i>Macmillan</i> was the original publisher of Alice in 1865 and is proud to remain true to the vision of its creators. Every bit as iconic are Sir John Tenniel's remarkable illustrations, perfectly capturing the combination of the ordinary and the extraordinary at the heart of Wonderland.</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Despite the publication of hundreds of textbooks in this field, each one intended to provide an improvement over previous textbooks, students of electromagnetics continue to remain perplexed as a result of numerous subject areas that must be remembered and correlated when solving problems. Various interpretations of electromagnetics terms also contribute to the difficulties of mastering the subject.<br><br>In a study of electromagnetics, REA found the following basic reasons underlying the inherent difficulties of electromagnetics:<br><br>No systematic rules of analysis were ever developed to follow in a step-by-step manner to solve typically encountered problems. This results from numerous different conditions and principles involved in a problem which leads to many possible different solution methods. To prescribe a set of rules for each of the possible variations would involve an enormous number of additional steps, making this task more burdensome than solving the problem directly due to the expectation of much trial and error.<br><br>Current textbooks normally explain a given principle in a few pages written by an electromagnetics professional who has insight into the subject matter not shared by others. These explanations are often written in an abstract manner that causes confusion as to the principle's use and application. Explanations then are often not sufficiently detailed or extensive enough to make the reader aware of the wide range of applications and different aspects of the principle being studied. The numerous possible variations of principles and their applications are usually not discussed, and it is left to the reader to discover this while doing exercises. Accordingly, the average student is expected to rediscover that which has long been established and practiced, but not always published or adequately explained.<br><br>The examples typically following the explanation of a topic are too few in number and too simple to enable the student to obtain a thorough grasp of the involved principles. The explanations do not provide sufficient basis to solve problems that may be assigned for homework or given on examinations.<br><br>Poorly solved examples such as these can be presented in abbreviated form which leaves out much explanatory material between steps, and as a result requires the reader to figure out the missing information. This leaves the reader with an impression that the problems and even the subject are hard to learn - completely the opposite of what an example is supposed to do.<br><br>Poor examples are often worded in a confusing or obscure way. They might not state the nature of the problem or they present a solution, which appears to have no direct relation to the problem. These problems usually offer an overly general discussion - never revealing how or what is to be solved.<br><br>Many examples do not include accompanying diagrams or graphs, denying the reader the exposure necessary for drawing good diagrams and graphs. Such practice only strengthens understanding by simplifying and organizing electromagnetics processes.<br><br>Students can learn the subject only by doing the exercises themselves and reviewing them in class, obtaining experience in applying the principles with their different ramifications.<br><br>In doing the exercises by themselves, students find that they are required to devote considerable more time to electromagnetics than to other subjects, because they are uncertain with regard to the selection and application of the theorems and principles involved. It is also often necessary for students to discover those "tricks" not revealed in their texts (or review books) that make it possible to solve problems easily. Students must usually resort to methods of trial and error to discover these "tricks," therefore finding out that they may sometimes spend several hours to solve a single problem.<br><br>When reviewing the exercises in classrooms, instructors usually request students to take turns in writing solutions on the boards and explaining them to the class. Students often find it difficult to explain in a manner that holds the interest of the class, and enables the remaining students to follow the material written on the boards. The remaining students in the class are thus too occupied with copying the material off the boards to follow the professor's explanations.<br><br>This book is intended to aid students in electromagnetics overcome the difficulties described by supplying detailed illustrations of the solution methods that are usually not apparent to students. Solution methods are illustrated by problems that have been selected from those most often assigned for class work and given on examinations. The problems are arranged in order of complexity to enable students to learn and understand a particular topic by reviewing the problems in sequence. The problems are illustrated with detailed, step-by-step explanations, to save the students large amounts of time that is often needed to fill in the gaps that are usually found between steps of illustrations in textbooks or review/outline books.<br><br>The staff of REA considers electromagnetics a subject that is best learned by allowing students to view the methods of analysis and solution techniques. This learning approach is similar to that practiced in various scientific laboratories, particularly in the medical fields.<br><br>In using this book, students may review and study the illustrated problems at their own pace; students are not limited to the time such problems receive in the classroom.<br><br>When students want to look up a particular type of problem and solution, they can readily locate it in the book by referring to the index that has been extensively prepared. It is also possible to locate a particular type of problem by glancing at just the material within the boxed portions. Each problem is numbered and surrounded by a heavy black border for speedy identification.<br></p><p></p><h2>Selected Stories of H. G. Wells (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><b>Ursula K.

G. Wells</b> was born Herbert George in Bromley, Kent, England, on September 21, 1866. His father was a professional cricketer and sometimes shopkeeper, his mother a former lady's maid. Although "Bertie" left school at fourteen to become a draper's apprentice (a life he detested), he later won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in London, where he studied with the famous Thomas Henry Huxley. He began to sell articles and short stories regularly in 1893. In 1895, his immediately successful novel rescued him from a life of penury on a schoolteacher's salary. His other "scientific romances"&#x2014;<i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i>&nbsp;(1896),&nbsp;<i>The Invisible Man&nbsp;</i>(1897),&nbsp;<i>The War of the Worlds&nbsp;</i>(1898),&nbsp;<i>The First Men in the Moon</i>&nbsp;(1901), and&nbsp;<i>The War in the Air&nbsp;</i>(1908)&#x2014;won him the distinction as the father of science fiction. Henry James saw in Wells the most gifted writer of the age, but Wells, having coined the phrase "the war that will end war" to describe World War I, became increasingly disillusioned and focused his attention on educating mankind with his bestselling&nbsp;<i>Outline of History</i>&nbsp;(1920) and his later utopian works. Living until 1946, Wells witnessed a world more terrible than any of his imaginative visions, and he bitterly observed: "Reality has taken a leaf from my book and set itself to supercede me."<br><br><b>Ursula K.

On each table stood a couple of glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels, frogs, and guineapigs upon which the students had been working, and down the side of the room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing bleached dissections of spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed anatomical drawings in whitewood frames and overhanging a row of cubical lockers. All the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard, and on these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous day's work. The laboratory was empty, save for the demonstrator, who sat near the preparation-room door, and silent, save for a low, continuous murmur, and the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working. But scattered about the room were traces of numerous students: hand-bags, polished boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing covered by newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of News from Nowhere, a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These things had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the closed door, the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering. Presently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the Oratory clock striking the hour of eleven. The clicking of the microtome ceased, and the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his hands into his pockets, and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre door. He stood listening for a moment, and then his eye fell on the little volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled, opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer ceased, there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the lecture theatre, stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of voices speaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which began to open, and stood ajar as some indistinctly heard question arrested the newcomer. The demonstrator turned, walked slowly back past the microtome, and left the laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or stood in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated America in the matter years ago-mixed socially too, for the prestige of the College is high, and its scholarships, free of any age limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch universities. The class numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in the theatre questioning the professor, copying the blackboard diagrams before they were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the day's teaching. Of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman wearing spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of the window at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking, plain-faced schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other a pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a well-fitting brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn the eye specialist. The others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a dwarfed, spectacled figure with a hunch back, sat on a bent wood stool; two others, one a short, dark youngster and the other a flaxen-haired, reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning side by side against the slate sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the largest share of the conversation. This last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow, of the same age as Wedderburn; he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of an indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features. He talked rather louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply into his pockets. His collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless laundress, his clothes were evidently ready-made, and there was a patch on the side of his boot near the toe. And as he talked or listened to the others, he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door. They were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just heard, the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology. "From ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata," the lecturer had said in his melancholy tones, and so had neatly rounded off the sketch of comparative anatomy he had been developing. The spectacled hunchback had repeated it with noisy appreciation, had tossed it towards the fair-haired student with an evident provocation, and had started one of those vague, rambling discussions on generalities so unaccountably dear to the student mind all the world over. "That is our goal, perhaps-I admit it, as far as science goes," said the fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. "But there are things above science." "Science," said Hill confidently, "is systematic knowledge. Ideas that don't come into the system-must anyhow-be loose ideas." He was not quite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his hearers took it seriously. "The thing I cannot understand," said the hunchback, at large, "is whether Hill is a materialist or not." "There is one thing above matter," said Hill promptly, feeling he made a better point this time, aware, too, of someone in the doorway behind him, and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, "and that is, the delusion that there is something above matter." "So we have your gospel at last," said the fair student. "It's all a delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead something more than dogs' lives, all our work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how inconsistent you are. Your socialism, for instance. Why do you trouble about the interests of the race? Why do you concern yourself about the beggar in the gutter? Why are you bothering yourself to lend that book"-he indicated William Morris by a movement of the head-"to everyone in the lab?" "Girl," said the hunchback indistinctly, and glanced guiltily over his shoulder. The girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory, and stood on the other side of the table behind him, with her rolled-up apron in one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the discussion. She did not notice the hunchback, because she was glancing from Hill to his interlocutor. Hill's consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her only in his studious ignoring of the fact; but she understood that, and it pleased her. "I see no reason," said he, "why a man should live like a brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter, and does not expect to exist a hundred years hence." "Why shouldn't he?" said the fair-haired student. "Why should he?" said Hill. "What inducement has he?" "That's the way with all you religious people. It's all a business of inducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness' sake?" There was a pause. The fair man answered, with a kind of vocal padding, "But-you see-inducement-when I said inducement," to gain time. And then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question. He was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions, and they invariably took one form-a demand for a definition. "What's your definition of righteousness?" said the hunchback at this stage. Hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question, but even as it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the laboratory attendant, who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number of freshly killed guineapigs by their hind legs. "This is the last batch of material this session," said the youngster who had not previously spoken. Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a couple of guineapigs at each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came crowding in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out. Hill was already standing by his table, and his box of scalpels was sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him, and leaning over his table said softly, "Did you see that I returned your book, Mr. Hill?" During the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his consciousness; but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and seeing it for the first time. "Oh yes," he said, taking it up. "I see. Did you like it?" "I want to ask you some questions about it-some time." "Certainly," said Hill. "I shall be glad." He stopped awkwardly. "You liked it?" he said. "It's a wonderful book. Only some things I don't understand." Then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious braying noise. It was the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day's instruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway between the "Er" of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. The girl in brown slipped back to her place: it was immediately in front of Hill's, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, took a notebook out of the drawer of his table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy pencil from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious note of the coming demonstration. For demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the College students. Books, saving only the professor's own, you may-it is even expedient to-ignore. Hill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical College. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week, and found that, with proper care, this also covered his clothing allowance, an occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles and cotton and such-like necessaries for a man about town. This was his first year and his first session, but the brown old man in Landport had already got himself detested in many public-houses by boasting of his son, "the Professor." Hill was a vigorous youngster, with a serene contempt for the clergy of all denominations, and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world. He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity. He had begun to read at seven, and had read steadily whatever came in his way, good or bad, since then. His worldly experience had been limited to the island of Portsea, and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day, after passing the seventh standard of the Board school. He had a considerable gift of speech, as the College Debating Society, which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models in the metallurgical theatre downstairs, already recognised-recognised by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a broad valley at one's feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and tremendous achievements. And his own limitations, save that he knew that he knew neither Latin nor French, were all unknown to him. At first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his biological work at the College and social and theological theorising, an employment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big museum library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room in Chelsea with his coat and a muffler on, and write out the lecture notes and revise his dissection memoranda until Thorpe called him out by a whistle-the landlady objected to open the door to attic visitors-and then the two would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit streets, talking, very much in the fashion of the sample just given, of the God Idea and Righteousness and Carlyle and the Reorganisation of Society. And in the midst of it all, Hill, arguing not only for Thorpe but for the casual passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed. Science and Righteousness! But once or twice lately there had been signs that a third interest was creeping into his life, and he had found his attention wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning of the blastopore, to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat at the table before him. She was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes to speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had, and the accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became abject within him. She had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid of a rabbit's skull, and he had found that, in biology at least, he had no reason for self-abasement. And from that, after the manner of young people starting from any starting-point, they got to generalities, and while Hill attacked her upon the question of socialism-some instinct told him to spare her a direct assault upon her religion-she was gathering resolution to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education. She was a year or two older than he, though the thought never occurred to him. The loan of News from Nowhere was the beginning of a series of cross loans. Upon some absurd first principle of his, Hill had never "wasted time" upon poetry, and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her. One day in the lunch hour, when she chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the skeletons were arranged, shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday meal, she retreated, and returned to lend him, with a slightly furtive air, a volume of Browning. He stood sideways towards her and took the book rather clumsily, because he was holding the bun in the other hand. And in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful clearness he could have wished.</p><h2>Developing The Leader Within You 2.0</h2><p>In this new, 2.0 edition of his now-classic work, John C.

In <b>Race Woman</b>, Gerald Horne draws a revealing portrait of this controvertial figure who championed the civil rights movement in America, the liberation struggles in Africa and the socialist struggles in Maoist China. Through careful analysis and use of personal correspondence, interviews, and previously unexamined documents, Horne explores her work as a Harlem Renaissance playwright, biographer, composer, teacher, novelist, Left political activist, advisor and inspiration, who was a powerful historical actor.</p></p><p><p><b>Gerald Horne</b> is Moores Professor of History and African-American Studies at the University of Houston. His books include <i>Race Woman: The Lives of Shirley Graham Du Bois</i> and <i>Race War!: White Supremacy and the Japanese Attack on the British Empire</i> (both available from NYU Press).</p>Largely remembered as the widow of W.E.B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois (1896-1977) was much more than a faithful caretaker and companion to her legendary husband. As Horne (Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s) reveals in this impressive biography, she was a restless, multifaceted woman. Reared in a strict Calvinist home, the daughter of a minister in Indianapolis, Ind., she understood that a solid education could free her from the limited existence of most women in her time. A youthful excursion into marriage ended in divorce, but not before Graham Du Bois became the mother of two sons. Horne, a Fulbright scholar and professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, does not judge Graham Du Bois's tortured decision to leave her boys with her parents so that she could conquer the world. After moving to Paris during the wild 1920s, she returned to the U.S. to produce her hit opera, Tom-Tom, then submerged herself in the heady academic atmosphere of Oberlin University. Horne also diligently evokes her political commitment to the civil rights movement, women's rights and anti-colonial struggles in Africa and Asia. Graham Du Bois wanted to control the flow of her life, but all of that changed when she met W.E.B. Du Bois, whom she married in his declining years, while he was under attack from McCarthy's Red hunters. Horne's observations on the couple's final days in Africa in 1963 and Graham Du Bois's subsequent globe trotting, especially her infatuation with Maoist China, are eloquent and rich with telling anecdotes about such figures as Malcolm X, Adam Clayton Powell, Nasser, Nkrumah and Zhou Enlai. Drawing on Graham Du Bois's personal papers and extensive interviews with family and friends, Horne's book may not completely unravel the enigma of Shirley Graham Du Bois, but it gets closer to her heart and soul than any previous attempt.

But the key ingredient that makes the sophisticated scent linger on the skin is precisely this bizarre digestive by-product&#x2014;ambergris. Despite being one of the world&#x2019;s most expensive substances (its value is nearly that of gold and has at times in history been triple it), ambergris is also one of the world&#x2019;s least known. But with this unusual and highly alluring book, Christopher Kemp promises to change that by uncovering the unique history of ambergris. <br><br>A rare secretion produced only by sperm whales, which have a fondness for squid but an inability to digest their beaks, ambergris is expelled at sea and floats on ocean currents for years, slowly transforming, before it sometimes washes ashore looking like a nondescript waxy pebble. It can appear almost anywhere but is found so rarely, it might as well appear nowhere. Kemp&#x2019;s journey begins with an encounter on a New Zealand beach with a giant lump of faux ambergris&#x2014;determined after much excitement to nothing more exotic than lard&#x2014;that inspires a comprehensive quest to seek out ambergris and its story. He takes us from the wild, rocky New Zealand coastline to Stewart Island, a remote, windswept island in the southern seas, to Boston and Cape Cod, and back again. Along the way, he tracks down the secretive collectors and traders who populate the clandestine modern-day ambergris trade. <br><br><i>Floating Gold</i> is an entertaining and lively history that covers not only these precious gray lumps and those who covet them, but presents a highly informative account of the natural history of whales, squid, ocean ecology, and even a history of the perfume industry.&nbsp;Kemp&#x2019;s obsessive curiosity is infectious, and eager readers will feel as though they have stumbled upon a precious bounty of this intriguing substance. </p></p><p><p><b>Christopher Kemp</b> is a scientist living in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<br> &nbsp;</p><p></p>&#x201c;In this wonderful&#x2014;and surprisingly gripping&#x2014;book, Christopher Kemp examines the curious history of one of the world's rarest and most magical substances.

Dr. Gustafson presents the chief inventors of all three positions - Freud and Reich within; Bateson, the Milan Family Therapy Team and Maturana without; and Alexander and French, Sullivan, Balint and Winnicott between. For contrast, he shows the logic of long-term psychotherapy in Havens and Gedo, and the formulae of brief psychotherapy in the schools of Malan, Mann, Sifneos and Davanloo, in order to consider what a full integration of brief psychotherapy would require, in its opening, middle and end games.

It serves not only as legal bedrock for the world's most powerful nation-state, but also, more broadly, it reflects that nation's fundamental aspirations and commitments as a society.<br> <br> Who then has the authority to interpret a blueprint of such extraordinary influence? Americans have come to treat the Constitution as something beyond their competence, something whose meaning should be decided by judges, assisted by a cadre of trained lawyers and academics. Yet this submission to a lawyerly elite is a radical and troublesome departure from what was originally the case. For America's founding generation celebrated the central role of "the people" in supplying government with its energy and direction.<br> <br> In this groundbreaking interpretation of America's founding and its concept of constitutionalism, Larry Kramer reveals how the first generations of Americans fought for and gave birth to a very different system from our current one and held a very different understanding of citizenship from that of most Americans today. "Popular sovereignty" was more than an empty abstraction, more than a mythic philosophical justification for government, and the idea of "the people" was more than a flip rhetorical gesture to be used on the campaign trail. Ordinary Americans exercised active control and sovereignty over their Constitution. The constitutionality of governmental action met with vigorous public debate in struggles whose outcomes might be greeted with celebratory feasts and bonfires, or with belligerent resistance. The Constitution remained, fundamentally, an act of popular will: the people's charter, made by the people. And it was "the people themselves" who were responsible for seeing that it was properly interpreted and implemented.<br> <br> With this book, Larry Kramer vaults to the forefront of constitutional theory and interpretation. In the process, he rekindles the original spark of "We, the People," inviting every citizen to join him in reclaiming the Constitution's legacy as, in Franklin D. Roosevelt's words, "a layman's instrument of government" and not "a lawyer's contract."<br> <br></p><p><br><strong>Larry Kramer</strong> is Russell D. Niles Professor of Law at New York University.

Brennan, Jr., of the United States Supreme Court and taught at the law schools of both the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan before moving to NYU. He has written extensively in both academic and popular journals on topics involving the role of courts in society.<br><br>"...masterful opening chapters...deserves great praise for his detailed historical research, which recaptures the flavor of early constitutionalism and its deep connection with an active and spirited American people. He also deserves great praise for untangling the different conceptions of "constitution" floating around and rendering that understanding easily accessible to a modern audience...a provocative and original analysis of American constitutionalism that will command a wide audience."--<em>Perspectives on Politics</em><p></p><br>"Offers a fresh way of viewing the origins and limits of judicial review. <em>The People Themselves</em> challenges conventional constitutional jurisprudence and conventional constitutional history with a deeply researched historical pedigree for popular refusal to accept the Supreme Court's usurping title to the people's document."--<em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Mr. Kramer is to be applauded for reminding us that courts do not enjoy a monopoly on the Constitution's true meaning and that senators and presidents alike should take the Constitution seriously in the confirmation process and at other times as well."--<em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"An instructive tour through the early history of American constitutionalism."--<em>National Review</em><p></p><br>"Larry Kramer explains one of the great mysteries of modern America--why for 40 years, have the freest people in the world been powerless to stop courts of appointed lawyers from eroding their freedoms?.... A manual on how the American people can legitimately exercise their historic right to create what he calls popular constitutionalism."--Newt Gingrich, <em>The New York Post</em><p></p><br>"Rarely since Edmund Burke's 'Speech on Conciliation with America' in 1774 has the legal dimension of the American Revolution been understood with such precision and presented with such conviction."--<em>First Things</em><p></p><br>"This book is perhaps the most important work of constitutional theory and history in a generation."--Mark Tushnet, author of <em>Taking the Constitution Away from the Courts</em><p></p><br>"Larry Kramer's important project offers a refeshing challenge to the hackneyed story that places John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison at the center of the history of constitutional interpretation. Kramer restores to our historical understanding a lost world of popular constitutionalism, where the resolution of fundamental issues was regarded not as the private property of courts and judges but of the people themselves. And I cannot think of a better moment for such a challenge, because we live in an era when doubtful claims for the ultimate authority of the Supreme Court on all matters constitutional are again being heard in the land."--Jack Rakove, author of <em>Original Meanings</em><p></p><br>"An intelligent and stimulating book. Unlike many law professors writing history, Kramer is very sensitive to context and differing historical circumstances. He offers an impressive and powerful argument for the origins of judicial review."--Gordon Wood, author of <em>The Radicalism of the American</em> <em>Revolution</em><p></p><br>"This is the best account to date of the development of the power of judicial review in an age of revolutionary politics, and this history challenges us to ask what it really means to live in a democracy today. A fascinating work that deserves a wide audience."--Keith Whittington, author of <em>Constitutional Construction</em><p></p><br>"Kramer's history is absorbing, his political theory subtle. He puts flesh on the bones of debates over judicial review and popular constitutionalism. With a sure and rare conceptual touch, he traces, and correlates to other political events, modulations over time in the American idea of the Constitution as law. As he does so, he rings the changes on this idea's perceived implications regarding the justifications, self-understandings, and modes of conduct of judicial review."--Frank Michelman, Harvard Law School<p></p><br></p><h2>The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Admiral Raymond A.

For Sloterdijk, life is a matter of form and, in life, sphere formation and thought are two different labels for the same thing.

It can ruin families, wreck one's health, destroy peace of mind and, at its worst, lead to murder, genocide, and war.<br><br>In <em>Anger</em>, Robert A. F. Thurman, best-selling author and one of America's leading authorities on Buddhism and Eastern philosophy, offers an illuminating look at this deadliest of sins. In the West, Thurman points out, anger is seen as an inevitable part of life, an evil to be borne, not overcome. There is the tradition of the wrathful God, of Jesus driving the money-changers from the temple. If God can be angry, how can men rid themselves of this destructive emotion? Thurman shows that Eastern philosophy sees anger differently. Certainly, it is a dreadful evil, one of the "three poisons" that underlie all human suffering. But Buddhism teaches that anger can be overcome. Indeed, the defeat of anger is not only possible, but also the only thing worth doing in a lifetime. Thurman shows how to recognize the destructiveness of anger and understand its workings, and how we can go from being a slave to anger to becoming "a knight of patience." We discover finally that when this deadliest emotion is transmuted by wisdom, it can become the most powerful force in freeing us from human suffering. <br><br>Drawing on the time-tested wisdom of Buddhism, Robert A. F. Thurman ranges from the individual struggle with anger to global crises spurred by dogmatic ideologies, religious fanaticism, and racial prejudice. He offers a path of calm understanding in a time of terrorism and war.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert A. F.

She then became a Head Start volunteer and ended up as a teacher in a preschool for Spanish-speaking children and their families in 1970&#x2019;s. She has also helped open several pilot programs including a therapeutic child care program and a home-based bilingual preschool program. When Magda Gerber came into her life in the mid-1970&#x2019;s, Janet signed up for an internship with her at the Children&#x2019;s Health Council in Menlo Park, California. As a result of that experience, later, when she became a child care director, she was able to incorporate much of what she learned into her work and was influential in expanding that program to include an infant center. Training and teaching adults has always been sideline, even when she was working with children and families. She worked as a Head Start trainer and as adjunct faculty in 4 community colleges plus the University of California Santa Cruz credential extension program. She taught for 15 years as full time faculty at Napa Valley College in the Child and Family Studies Program. Since 1991, she has been part of the faculty for WestEd&#x2019;s Program for Infant-Toddler Caregivers (PITC) Training of Trainer Institutes. Janet has been writing along with teaching for all these years and is author of numerous articles and 13 books related to early childhood, including Foundations of Early Childhood Education; Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers (with co-author Dianne Eyer); and Diversity in Early Care and Education: Honoring Differences (Formerly Multicultural Issues in Child Care). She wrote Dragon Mom about herself as parent to help early childhood professionals alleviate guilt when their parenting doesn't live up to their high standards. Her latest passion is understanding more about the Pikler Institute in Budapest, Hungary, where Magda Gerber came from. It took her 30 years to get there after she first heard of it, but her first trip to it in November of 2003 merely whetted her appetite. She has made two more since and is planning for another one. She is fascinated by the approach and is convinced that this residential nursery is a model for the world. She is continuing to learn more about how this approach can be used to improve infant-toddler care and education programs in the United States. She is also working with a group in Mexico to explore how the approach might fit into their models of residential care for infants and toddlers. Janet has a Master of Arts Degree in Human Development from Pacific Oaks in Pasadena, California.</p><h2>Basic complex analysis</h2><p>Designed for mathematics, engineering and physical science students taking complex analysis for the first time, this book combines an exposition of basic theory with a variety of applications to the physical sciences and engineering.

The book covers editors, shells, and LILO and GRUB boot options. There's also coverage of Apache, Samba, Postfix, sendmail, CVS, Subversion, Emacs, vi, sed, gawk, and much more. Everything that system administrators, developers, and power users need to know about Linux is referenced here, and they will turn to this book again and again.</p></p><p><p>Ellen Siever is a writer and editor specializing in Linux and other open source topics.

Organized thematically, the four sections of the book consider the subjugation of Eastern Europe by Stalinist Russia, show how criticism of Soviet domination culminated in the Hungarian uprising of 1956, describe the retreat from politics of many intellectuals after the crushing of the Prague Spring, and detail the resurgence of nationalism in the 1980s. An important and especially timely volume, <em>From Stalinism to</em> <em>Pluralism</em> clearly demonstrates the subtlety and richness of the political and philosophical world of Eastern Europe and offers fascinating insights into the how and why of the Eastern Bloc's return to pluralist development.</p><p></p><h2>Black Island (The Adventures of Tintin)</h2><p>Herge&#39;s classic comic book creation Tintin is one of the most iconic characters in children&#39;s books.

Lawyers advance bad ends and deceive, business managers exploit and despoil, public officials enforce unjust laws, and doctors keep confidences that, if disclosed, would prevent harm. <i>Ethics for Adversaries</i> is a philosophical inquiry into arguments that are offered to defend seemingly wrongful actions performed by those who occupy what Montaigne called "necessary offices."</p><br><p> Applbaum begins by examining the career of Charles-Henri Sanson, who is appointed executioner of Paris by Louis XVI and serves the punitive needs of the <i>ancien r�gime</i> for decades. Come the French Revolution, the King's Executioner becomes the king's executioner, and he ministers with professional detachment to each defeated political faction throughout the Terror and its aftermath. By exploring one extraordinary role and the arguments that can be offered in its defense, Applbaum raises unsettling doubts about arguments in defense of less sanguinary professions and their practices.</p><br><p> To justify harmful acts, adversaries appeal to arguments about the rules of the game, fair play, consent, the social construction of actions and actors, good outcomes in equilibrium, and the legitimate authority of institutions. Applbaum concludes that these arguments are weaker than supposed and do not morally justify much of the violation that professionals and public officials inflict. Institutions and the roles they create ordinarily cannot mint moral permissions to do what otherwise would be morally prohibited.</p></p><p><p>"This is an important and original contribution to moral philosophy and, in particular, to professional ethics. The argument is rigorous and well developed and the book is written with energy, flair, wit, and grace."--<b>Alan Wertheimer, University of Vermont</b></p> <p>"This is a brilliant approach to the vexing questions about ethical requirements of certain leading professions. No serious treatment of these issues will be able to proceed without considering Applbaum's thorough and pointed arguments. This book is, on the one hand, literate, witty and fun to read, and on the other, rigorous, careful, and technical when the argument requires it."--<b>David Estlund, Brown University</b></p> <p>"<i>Ethics for Adversaries</i> is a pathbreaking book. With a rare combination of rigorous theory and relevant examples, Arthur Applbaum presents a fair-minded and hard-hitting critique of professional ethics. He dissects the best arguments in favor of relaxing moral standards for lawyers, politicians, and adversaries in competitive practices of all kinds, and perceptively exposes their fundamental flaws."--<b>Amy Gutmann, Princeton University</b></p><b>Arthur Isak Applbaum</b> is Professor of Ethics and Public Policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and Director of Graduate Fellowships in the Harvard University Center for Ethics and the Professions.</p><h2>In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders and Their Guides</h2><p>America is a nation of ardent, knowledgeable birdwatchers. But how did it become so? And what role did the field guide play in our passion for spotting, watching, and describing birds? <br><br><em>In the Field, Among the Feathered</em> tells the history of field guides to birds in America from the Victorian era to the present, relating changes in the guides to shifts in science, the craft of field identification, and new technologies for the mass reproduction of images. Drawing on his experience as a passionate birder and on a wealth of archival research, Thomas Dunlap shows how the twin pursuits of recreation and conservation have inspired birders and how field guides have served as the preferred method of informal education about nature for well over a century. <br><br>The book begins with the first generation of late 19th-century birdwatchers who built the hobby when opera glasses were often the best available optics and bird identification was sketchy at best. As America became increasingly urban, birding became more attractive, and with Roger Tory Peterson's first field guide in 1934, birding grew in both popularity and accuracy. By the 1960s recreational birders were attaining new levels of expertise, even as the environmental movement made birding's other pole, conservation, a matter of human health and planetary survival. Dunlap concludes by showing how recreation and conservation have reached a new balance in the last 40 years, as scientists have increasingly turned to amateurs, whose expertise had been honed by the new guides, to gather the data they need to support habitat preservation. <br><br>Putting nature lovers and citizen-activists at the heart of his work, Thomas Dunlap offers an entertaining history of America's long-standing love affair with birds, and with the books that have guided and informed their enthusiasm.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas R. Dunlap</strong> is Professor of History at Texas A&amp;M University, He is the author of <em>Faith in Nature: Environmentalism As Religious Quest</em>.<br><br>"<em>n the Field</em> will be fascinating reading for any birder, naturalist, or student of environmental history. Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"<em>In the Field, Among the Feathered</em> should be read by birders of all stripes who want to know more about the evolution of their hobby (or obsession). It also makes an important contribution to environmental history, placing birding in its larger historical context. Dunlap shows how birding developed from a genteel activity for the well-to-do to an occasionally competitive sport, even as its practitioners kept an eye and an ear on environmental concerns."--Kurk Dorsey, author of <em>The Dawn of Conservation Diplomacy</em> <br><p></p><br>"Dunlap's brilliant environmental history of birders and their ubiquitous guides reveals new insights about a critical convergence of science, art, recreation, and conservation. His engaging and enlightening narrative demonstrates antecedents of our current enthusiasms for sustainability and clearly shows the critical role of citizen science and popular recreation in establishing the foundations for modern environmentalism. Wonderful and important."--Andy Kirk, author of <em>Counterculture Green</em><p></p><br>"Thomas Dunlap's book shows how North American field guides have evolved since 1889 to meet the ever-growing expertise of birders. With today's guides, birds that a hundred years ago could be identified only in the hand are easily distinguished by sight or by song in the field. Highly recommended for field naturalists, historians, and folks looking for an engaging hobby."--Chandler S. Robbins, senior author of <em>The Field Guide to Birds of North America</em><p></p><br></p><h2>And Still the Waters Run</h2><p><p>Debo's classic work tells the tragic story of the spoliation of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole nations at the turn of the last century in what is now the state of Oklahoma. After their earlier forced removal from traditional lands in the southeastern states--culminating in the devastating 'trail of tears' march of the Cherokees--these five so-called Civilized Tribes held federal land grants in perpetuity, or "as long as the waters run, as long as the grass grows." Yet after passage of the Dawes Act in 1887, the land was purchased back from the tribes, whose members were then systematically swindled out of their private parcels.</p><br><p>The publication of Debo's book fundamentally changed the way historians viewed, and wrote about, American Indian history. Writers from Oliver LaFarge, who characterized it as "a work of art," to Vine Deloria, Jr., and Larry McMurtry acknowledge debts to Angie Debo. Fifty years after the book's publication, McMurtry praised Debo's work in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>: "The reader," he wrote, "is pulled along by her strength of mind and power of sympathy."</p><br><p>Because the book's findings implicated prominent state politicians and supporters of the University of Oklahoma, the university press there was forced to reject the book in .... for fear of libel suits and backlash against the university.

She shows the very human struggles associated with losing your partner, your friend, and your love. She asks the difficult questions that any person would have but may not readily admit.

But even the hardest of these problems can often be solved with a computer and a Monte Carlo simulation, in which a random-number generator simulates a physical process, such as a million rolls of a pair of dice. This is what <i>Digital Dice</i> is all about: how to get numerical answers to difficult probability problems without having to solve complicated mathematical equations.</p><p> Popular-math writer Paul Nahin challenges readers to solve twenty-one difficult but fun problems, from determining the odds of coin-flipping games to figuring out the behavior of elevators. Problems build from relatively easy (deciding whether a dishwasher who breaks most of the dishes at a restaurant during a given week is clumsy or just the victim of randomness) to the very difficult (tackling branching processes of the kind that had to be solved by Manhattan Project mathematician Stanislaw Ulam). In his characteristic style, Nahin brings the problems to life with interesting and odd historical anecdotes. Readers learn, for example, not just how to determine the optimal stopping point in any selection process but that astronomer Johannes Kepler selected his second wife by interviewing eleven women.</p><p> The book shows readers how to write elementary computer codes using any common programming language, and provides solutions and line-by-line walk-throughs of a MATLAB code for each problem.</p><p><i>Digital Dice</i> will appeal to anyone who enjoys popular math or computer science.</p></p><p><p>"Paul Nahin's <i>Digital Dice</i> is a marvelous book, one that is even better than his<i>Duelling Idiots</i>. Nahin presents twenty-one great probability problems, from George Gamow's famous elevator paradox (as corrected by Donald Knuth) to a bewildering puzzle involving two rolls of toilet paper, and he solves them all with the aid of Monte Carlo simulations and brilliant, impeccable reasoning."<b>--Martin Gardner</b></p><p>"Nahin's new book is a rich source of tantalizing, real-life probability puzzles that require considerable ingenuity, and in most cases computer simulation, to solve. Though written to be delved into rather than read cover-to-cover,<i>Digital Dice</i> has an engaging and often witty style that makes each chapter a pleasurable read."<b>--Keith Devlin, author of The<i>Math Gene</i> and <i>The Math Instinct</i></b></p><p>"Open this delightful, matchless book to be sucked into a treasure trove of wonderful conundrums of everyday life. Then, persuaded by straightforward Monte Carlo simulation exercises, emerge refreshed, invigorated, and fully satisfied by the unique experience of learning from Nahin's marvelous <i>Digital Dice</i>."<b>--Joseph Mazur, author of<i>The Motion Paradox</i></b></p><p>"One of the strengths of <i>Digital Dice</i> is its wealth of historical information. Nahin carefully notes the origin of each problem and traces its history. He also tells a number of amusing anecdotes. I found all the problems interesting, especially Parrondo's Paradox. Anyone who has not met this paradox will be amazed by it! <i>Digital Dice</i> is a very enjoyable read."<b>--Nick Hobson, creator of the award-winning Web site Nick's Mathematical Puzzles</b></p><p>"By presenting problems for which complete theoretical analysis is difficult or currently impossible,<i>Digital Dice</i> is a reminder that mathematics is often advanced by investigation, long before theoretical tools are brought to bear. The book's choice of problems is eclectic and interesting, and the explanations are clear and easy to read. A welcome addition to popular mathematical literature."<b>--Julian Havil, author of <i>Nonplussed!: Mathematical Proof of Implausible Ideas</i></b></p><b>Paul J.

It provides a fascinating account of his intellectual and political itinerary before <i>Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</i> (1972), the ground-breaking book he wrote with Gilles Deleuze, propelled him to the forefront of contemporary French philosophy. </p><p>Guattari's background was unlike that of any of his peers. In 1953, with psychoanalyst Jean Oury, he founded the La Borde psychiatric clinic, which was based on the principle that one cannot treat psychotics without modifying the entire institutional context. For Guattari, the purpose of &#x201c;institutional psychotherapy&#x201d; was not just to cure psychotic patients, but also to learn with them a different relation to the world. A dissident in the French Communist Party and active in far-left politics (he participated in the May 1968 student rebellion), Guattari realized early on that it was possible to introduce analysis into political groups. Considered as open machines (subject-groups) rather than self-contained structures (subjugated groups), these subject-groups shunned hierarchy and vertical structures, developing transversally, rhizomatizing through other groups. </p><p><i>Psychoanalysis and Transversality</i> collects twenty-four essays by Guattari, including his foundational 1964 article on transversality, and a superb introduction by Gilles Deleuze, &#x201c;Three Group-Related Problems.&#x201d;</p></p><p>F�lix Guattari (1930&#x2013;1992), post-'68 French psychoanalyst and philosopher, is the author of <i>Anti-Oedipus </i>(with Gilles Deleuze), and a number of books published by Semiotext(e), including <i>The Anti-Oedipus Papers, Chaosophy</i>, and <i>Soft Subversions.</i><br><br>Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII, Vincennes/Saint Denis. He published 25 books, including five in collaboration with F�lix Guattari.</p><h2>The Nineteenth Century: Europe 1789-1914 (Short Oxford History of Europe)</h2><p>In the nineteenth century Europe changed more rapidly and more radically than during any prior period. These six specially commissioned chapters by eminent historians offer the student and general reader a unique approach to understanding one of the most complex periods of modern history, addressing all the major issues in Europe's political, social, economic, cultural, international, and Imperial history.<br></p><p>Europe underwent colossal political, economic, and social change in the long century between the fall of the Bastille in 1789 and the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in 1914, and this volume in the <i>Short Oxford History of Europe</i> provides an expert and entertaining overview of the principal developments. This is sonic-boom history, with Professor T.C.W. Blanning and his team placing a firm emphasis on the modernizing and global transformations at work, although there are important reminders along the way of the persistence of monarchy and the established church.<p> Here, for a change, Europe manifestly includes Britain, which makes for a thoughtful perspective on all manner of comparisons and contrasts. Particularly enjoyable are Niall Ferguson's survey of economic change, spiced with sideline commentary from Dickens and Wagner, and Tony Hopkins's sweep through the history of European imperialism. Readers may find some of the chapters too absorbed with historiography, rather than history, and perhaps everyone pays too much attention to Blanning's dictum that the 19th was the "German century." One wonders what a group of Mediterranean or Eastern European scholars would have made of such a topic. But for a readable history written by specialists, this book is hard to beat. <i>--Miles Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br>T.C.W. Blanning is Professor of Modern European History at the University of Cambridge.<br></p><h2>Basics of Vocal Pedagogy</h2><p><i>Basics of Vocal Pedagogy</i> is a comprehensive introductory text for vocal pedagogy classes at the college and university level. Though written primarily for prospective teachers of singing, vocal music educators, choir directors, voice coaches and intermediate to advanced level singers will also find the text useful as a textbook, training manual, and general reference book.</p><p></p><h2>Revolution From Above: The Demise of the Soviet System</h2><p>This book argues that the ruling state party in the USSR itself moved to dismantle the old system. Research includes interviews with over 50 former Soviet government and Communist party leaders, policy advisors, trade unionists and businessmen.</p><p>This book gives a new interpretation of the disintegration of the USSR. It challenges the widespread belief that the demise of the old regime was caused by the collapse of the Soviet economy, accompanied by public demand that socialism should be abandoned....one of the best books yet to appear about what has happened in the former Soviet Union in this last tragic decade.... It is a good book because it is based on a careful, scholarly analysis of a laboriously collected treasury of facts.... This book is an eye-opener for anyone who is tired of the prevailing wisdom about today&#39;s Russia.</p><h2>Logic: The Essentials</h2><p>LOGIC: THE ESSENTIALS concentrates on the fundaments of introductory logic. Practical in orientation and content, Essentials is loaded with class-tested, proven practice exercises. This new text is based on the classic and bestselling textbook, A Concise Introduction to Logic, and nearly all of the exercises in the correlative chapters, so central to the effectiveness of that text, have been retained to ensure more than enough practice for students to master the central concepts. The book focuses largely on deductive logic, but it contains sufficient treatment of induction to provide a solid footing for informal fallacies. The result is a contemporary approach--more focused, more practical, less theoretical--built on a tradition of precise, elegant, and clear presentation of the subject matter of logic, both formal and informal.</p><p>Patrick Hurley received his bachelor&#39;s degree in mathematics (with a second major in philosophy and a physics minor) from Gonzaga University in 1964 and his Ph.D. in philosophy of science with an emphasis in history of philosophy from Saint Louis University in 1973. In 1972, he began teaching at the University of San Diego, where his courses included logic, philosophy of science, metaphysics, process philosophy, and legal ethics. In 1987, he received his J.D. from the University of San Diego, and he is currently a member of the California Bar Association. He retired from teaching in 2008, but continues his research and writing, including work on A Concise Introduction to Logic. His interests include music, art, opera, environmental issues, fishing, and skiing. He is married to Dr. Linda Peterson, who retired from teaching philosophy at the University of San Diego in 2015.&#34;[The new Hurley text would work] better than my current text, and past texts as well....We need a text that is short, simple, organized, direct, coverable in 14 weeks...; gives the students something they can use and apply to increase their intellect, critical thinking and argument evaluation skills, AND is as cheap as possible (while still maintaining aesthetic appeal [good paper, charts, appendix, etc.]).&#34;</p><h2>Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering</h2><p><p>Real-world engineering problems are rarely, if ever, neatly divided into mechanical, electrical, chemical, civil, and other categories. Engineers from all disciplines eventually encounter computer and electronic controls and instrumentation, which require at least a basic knowledge of electrical and other engineering specialties, as well as associated economics, and environmental, political, and social issues.</p> <p></p> <p>Co-authored by Charles Gross&#x2015;one of the most well-known and respected professors in the field of electric machines and power engineering&#x2015;and his world-renowned colleague Thad Roppel, <strong>Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering</strong> provides an overview of the profession for engineering professionals and students whose specialization lies in areas other than electrical. For instance, civil engineers must contend with commercial electrical service and lighting design issues. Mechanical engineers have to deal with motors in HVAC applications, and chemical engineers are forced to handle problems involving process control. </p> <p></p> <p>Simple and easy-to-use, yet more than sufficient in rigor and coverage of fundamental concepts, this resource teaches EE fundamentals but omits the typical analytical methods that hold little relevance for the audience. The authors provide many examples to illustrate concepts, as well as homework problems to help readers understand and apply presented material. </p> <p></p> <p>In many cases, courses for non-electrical engineers, or non-EEs, have presented watered-down classical EE material, resulting in unpopular courses that students hate and senior faculty members understandingly avoid teaching. To remedy this situation&#x2015;and create more well-rounded practitioners&#x2015;the authors focus on the true EE needs of non-EEs, as determined through their own teaching experience, as well as significant input from non-EE faculty. The book provides several important contemporary interdisciplinary examples to support this approach. The result is a full-color modern narrative that bridges the various EE and non-EE curricula and serves as a truly relevant course that students and faculty can both enjoy.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Outlaws of Cave-in-Rock (Shawnee Classics)</h2><p>Exceptionally rare and valued by book collectors, Otto A.

Presenting many eyewitness accounts, Rothert supplies the lore and legend of the colorful villains of Cave-in-Rock. Always maintaining the difference between stories he tells with historical authority and those that are pure speculation, Rothert provides both a fascinating narrative and a valuable regional history.<br><br></p><p>Exceptionally rare and valued by book collectors, Otto A. Rothert&#39;s riveting saga of the outlaws and scoundrels of Cave-in-Rock has not been available to the general public for decades. Rothert chronicles the adventures of an audacious cast of river pirates and highwaymen who operated in and around the famous Ohio River cavern from 1795 through 1820 (adventures featured in Disney&#39;s Davy Crockett and the film How the West Was Won). Once sporting the enticing sign &#34;Liquor Vault and House for Entertainment&#34;, this beautiful cavern location decoyed the unsuspecting by offering a venue for food, drink, and rest. As a &#34;scene for shrouded crime&#34;, Rothert notes, &#34;it was perfect&#34;. Rothert&#39;s predators range from the brutish Harpes and the gentleman-soldier-turned-brigand Samuel Mason to the mysterious James Ford, probably of the murderous Ford&#39;s Ferry gang. Where the Harpes were bloodthirsty and barbaric, Mason was shrewd. Mason never shed blood unless to protect himself, and he robbed for booty - not the joy of the kill. The last of the Cave-in-Rock outlaws, the Ford&#39;s Ferry gang, left many skeletons, yet their activities remain mysterious. In his foreword to this edition, Robert A. Clark notes that when Rothert queried the Arthur H. Clark Company regarding his manuscript in the spring of 1922, he wrote: &#34;I have an idea it will be interesting to those who &#39;dearly love the excitements of the criminally audacious.&#39;&#34; Rothert was correct. Compellingly lively, The Outlaws of Cave-in-Rock is nonetheless the work of a scholar, a historian who documents his findings and leaves a detailed bibliographical trail. Presenting many eyewitness accounts, Rothert supplies the lore and legend of the colorfulvillains of Cave-in-Rock. Always maintaining the difference between stories he tells with historical authority and those that are pure speculation, Rothert provides both a fascinating narrative and a valuable regional history.<p><b>Otto A.

Featuring such authors as Balzac, M�rim�e, Dumas, Verne, and Maupassant, this book offers readers familiar with the works of Edgar Allan Poe and E. T. A. Hoffman some of the most memorable stories in the genre. With its aura of the uncanny and the supernatural, the fantastic tale is a vehicle for exploring forbidden themes and the dark, irrational side of the human psyche.<br> <br> The anthology opens with "Smarra, or the Demons of the Night," Nodier's 1821 tale of nightmare, vampirism, and compulsion, acclaimed as the first work in French literature to explore in depth the realm of dream and the unconscious. Other stories include Balzac's "The Red Inn," in which a crime is committed by one person in thought and another in deed, and M�rim�e's superbly crafted mystery, "The Venus of Ille," which dramatizes the demonic power of a vengeful goddess of love emerging out of the pagan past. Gautier's protagonist in "The Dead in Love" develops an obsessive passion for a woman who has returned from beyond the grave, while the narrator of Maupassant's "The Horla" imagines himself a victim of psychic vampirism.<br> <br> Joan Kessler has prepared new translations of nine of the thirteen tales in the volume, including G�rard de Nerval's odyssey of madness, "Aur�lia," as well as two tales that have never before appeared in English. Kessler's introduction sets the background of these tales&#x2014;the impact of the French Revolution and the Terror, the Romantics' fascination with the subconscious, and the influence of contemporary psychological and spiritual currents. Her essay illuminates how each of the authors in this collection used the fantastic to articulate his own haunting obsessions as well as his broader vision of human experience.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French"Dream is a second life," begins Nerval's classic, "Aurelia," and that is the theme illuminated by this memorable anthology of supernatural tales of 19th-century French fiction. Kessler has gracefully translated nine of the 13 stories and written an introduction that puts the stories in an historical context of the French Revolution, the Terror and contemporary scientific and spiritualist schools of thought. Stories by Balzac, Dumas, Maupassant and Verne delve into that gray slip of a space between dreams and wakefulness where somnambulism is not the exception but rather the rule. The anthology opens with the first English appearance of Nodier's stunning "Smarra," in which vampires and nightmarish images violate the landscape. In Balzac's "The Red Inn," a crime is committed by one man in thought and by another in deed. In Merimee's compelling "The Venus of Ille," a demonically beautiful statue comes to life to exact revenge on a man who pays her disrespect. Severed heads do not mean severed tongues in Dumas's "The Slap of Charlotte Corday," (also in its first English translation), an effective exploration of irrational terror evoked by the subconscious. These haunting tales are definitely not bedtime stories for the faint of heart. But for stronger sorts, this superb anthology is a literary tour of the phantasmagoric landscape of dreams. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Screening Adult Neurologic Populations: A Step-by-Step Instruction Manual, 2nd Edition</h2><p>From traumatic brain injury to dementia, occupational therapists working with adults with neurological difficulties must be able to efficiently use various screening methods to pinpoint deficits and determine how they affect a client's daily functioning.

Youthful, enthusiastic, they become soldiers. But despite what they have learned, they break into pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches.

He is a craftsman of unquestionably first trank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure." <br>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</p><p>Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front, &#34; was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970.Muller&#39;s straightforward, simple delivery underscores the horror and hopelessness depicted in Remarque&#39;s powerful WWI novel. Germany&#39;s Iron Youth, represented by Paul Baumer and his friends, begin the war as teenagers sure of the justice of their cause and the glory that will be theirs. When these young men are confronted with trench warfare, dying in hellish agony, Paul must face the reality in which he finds himself and prepare for the world to which he will return, irrevocably changed. Reading with a calm, quiet sureness, which heightens the soul-destroying nightmare of Paul&#39;s ordeal, Muller&#39;s stunning performance demonstrates the reason for his huge following. Recommended by many high schools, this is a must for young adults. S.G.

Set in the early 1900s on the Canadian prairie, the story centers on Berta, the older, plain, dependable sister of cheerful, beautiful, affectionate Glenna. From childhood on, Berta feels ignored as pretty Glenna receives most of the attention from family, friends, and especially young men. She develops a protective shell so as not to compete with her sister's limelight. Circumstances and the stress of not revealing her true feelings finally cause the young woman to seek the advice of her minister. Both sisters eventually discuss their feelings and Berta discovers her "true self." Oke presents believable characters in a well-paced story full of insight and common sense. It will be especially appealing to any young adult who feels like a "sparrow" in comparison to the "bluebirds."

Some have charged that students were not learning enough, while others have complained that the schools were not in the forefront of social progress. In this authoritative history of education in the twentieth century, historian Diane Ravitch describes this ongoing battle of ideas and explains why school reform has so often failed. Left Back recounts grandiose efforts by education reformers to use the schools to promote social and political goals, even when they diminished the schools&#39; ability to educate children. It shows how generations of reformers have engaged in social engineering, advocating such innovations as industrial education, intelligence testing, curricular differentiation, and life-adjustment education. These reformers, she demonstrates, simultaneously mounted vigorous campaigns against academic studies. Left Back charges that American schools have been damaged by three misconceptions. The first is the belief that the schools can solve any social or political problem. The second is the belief that only a portion of youngsters are capable of benefiting from a high-quality education. The third is that imparting knowledge is relatively unimportant, compared to engaging students in activities and experiences. These grave errors, Ravitch contends, have unnecessarily restricted equality of educational opportunity. They have dumbed down the schools by encouraging a general lowering of academic expectations. They have produced a diluted and bloated curriculum and pressure to enlarge individual schools so that they can offer multiple tracks to children with different occupational goals. As a result, the typical American high school is too big, too anonymous, and lacks intellectual coherence. Ravitch identifies several heroic educators -- such as William T. Harris, William C. Bagley, and Isaac Kandel -- who challenged these dominant and wrong-headed ideas. These men, dissidents in their own times, are usually left out of standard histories of education or treated derisively because they believed that all children deserved the opportunity to meet high standards of learning. In describing the wars between competing traditions of education, Ravitch points the way to reviving American education. She argues that all students have the capacity to learn and that all are equally deserving of a solid liberal arts education. Left Back addresses issues of the utmost importance and urgency. It is a large work of history that by recovering the past illuminates a future.</p><p>In <i>Left Back</i>, Diane Ravitch explodes pervasive myths of how American schools developed in the last hundred years: "The conventional story of the twentieth century told by historians of education is about the heroic advance of the progressive education movement, how it vanquished oppressive traditionalism in the classroom, briefly dominated American schools, then lost its vitality and withered away in the mid-1950s." Ravitch, herself an eminent historian of education and the author of <i>The Great School Wars</i>, calls this so much malarkey. She reveals how an endless wave of reforms prevented schools from doing what they were built to do: educate children. "Whenever the academic curriculum was diluted or minimized, large numbers of children were pushed through the school system without benefit of a genuine education," she writes. These words may not be welcome at teacher-training colleges, where so many of the ill-begotten theories and half-baked ideas she chronicles now percolate. But classroom veterans will appreciate Ravitch's insights: "What was sacrificed over the decades in which the schools were treated as vehicles for job training, social planning, political reform, social sorting, personality adjustment, and social efficiency was a clear definition of what schools can realistically and appropriately accomplish for children and for society."<p> The bulk of <i>Left Back</i>--and it is a bulky book, both in size (467 pages of text) and intellectual heft--is a history of progressive education reforms and the bad consequences that often follow them. Yet it is more than just history; Ravitch constantly keeps her eye on lessons the present can draw from the past, and isn't afraid to reach controversial conclusions, as when she writes, "If there is a lesson to be learned from the river of ink that was spilled in the education disputes of the twentieth century, it is that anything in education that is labeled a 'movement' should be avoided like the plague." Ravitch may add to that river of ink, but to everyone's benefit. <i>Left Back</i> is a fine book that should find a wide audience--the jacket features glowing blurbs from liberal historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and conservative author William J. Bennett. More important, it deserves a wide audience. <i>--John J.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

The Makah, on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, resumed hunting the gray whale in the traditional manner when it was taken off the endangered species list in 1995; animal rights advocates arrived to protest. There is no index. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>On May 17, 1999, a crew of Makah Indians dug their paddles hard into the Pacific chop, came alongside their target, and for the first time in seven decades harpooned and killed a gray whale. News helicopters relayed footage of the "event" to television screens around the country. Protesters, kept at bay by Coast Guard cutters, blasted enraged bullhorns. Native Americans from tribes across the continent cheered in solidarity. Other U.S. citizens paused to watch, then debated some more. <p> Whales breach and sound through our collective imagination. They're smart. They communicate across the seas by song. But for centuries whalers slaughtered them in unspeakable numbers. Eventually people called for an end to industrial whaling. Enter the Makah, a small tribe in an isolated corner of Washington State that seeks to exercise its treaty rights and revive an ancient tradition. Robert Sullivan (<i>The Meadowlands</i>) spent two years visiting the mist-shrouded Makah Nation on Neah Bay to record what the fuss was about. He got to know the whaling participants personally, and he also met the protesters. He even followed by car the 5,000-mile whale migration, the longest of any mammalian species, down the coast to Baja and the birthing grounds. The result of his reportage is a closely observed portrait of one community's transformation--its "blood transfusion," as an elder calls it--as well as the spouting controversy. </p> <p> Sullivan tries not to take sides, but his sympathies are apparent. Animal rights activists come across as committed yet arrogant and self-righteous. For instance, the husband-and-wife founders of In the Path of Giants, a touring company and antiwhaling advocacy group, believe they can convince the Makah, with the aid of a slideshow, to take up whale <i>watching</i> instead of hunting, adding, "We can help them." More interesting to Sullivan than the controversy, however, is "what it would be like to try to kill a bus-sized mammal." He conveys the wonder of the Makah's enterprise (hunt a whale? in a canoe?) as well as the mundane chores (find the right harpoon shaft, pass a swimming test, practice paddling). It is this accumulation of detail rather than the politics or the acrimony that brings the book to life. Anchoring it is a narrative structure borrowed (with a few winks) from <i>Moby-Dick</i> as well as a series of footnotes drawing parallels between Melville's masterpiece and the Makah's endeavor. </p> <p> Sullivan also aims a few of his own harpoons--primarily at the media leviathan--as rhetoric increasingly rules the day in the weeks and months leading up to the kill. "We're not any different from any other community in the world," remarks a tribal member, "except that now everybody's watching us." Despite the close focus, Sullivan suggests that one of the many ironies of global connectivity and media saturation is an even greater distancing between <i>one</i> and the <i>other</i>, expertly parodying this distance in the final moments before the kill: </p> <blockquote> With the whaling canoe moving closer and closer to one whale, with the specter of this whale moving closer and closer to the surface ... with the whale hunt about to become an actuality, a done deed, the morning television host announced the following to the commuter at home, as if he were calling a prizefight or watching the police chase a runaway car: "Time is clearly running out for this whale." </blockquote> <p> Indeed, there is a sense of the clock running out for everyone involved. A wistfulness for times gone by permeates <i>A Whale Hunt</i> like a coastal fog that will not lift. The land, marred by clearcuts and oil spills, is not what it used to be; the legendary salmon runs are nearly gone, victims of dams, overfishing, development; the tribal members are searching in vain for jobs and meaning. It is an altered landscape, inhabited by an altered tribe trying to hold on to the last vestiges of its once-great history. <i>--Langdon Cook</i></p><b>Robert Sullivan,</b> a contributing editor at Vogue, is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The New Republic, The New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone,</i> and <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i> He is the author of <i>The Meadowlands,</i> a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year.

Rather than reproduce traditional understandings of nature and environment, Jake Kosek shifts the focus toward material and symbolic &#x201c;natures,&#x201d; seemingly unchangeable essences central to formations of race, class, and nation that are being remade not just through conflicts over resources but also through everyday practices by Chicano activists, white environmentalists, and state officials as well as nuclear scientists, heroin addicts, and health workers. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork and extensive archival research, he shows how these contentious natures are integral both to environmental politics and the formation of racialized citizens, politicized landscapes, and modern regimes of rule.<p></p><p>Kosek traces the histories of forest extraction and labor exploitation in northern New Mexico, where Hispano residents have forged passionate attachments to place. He describes how their sentiments of dispossession emerged through land tenure systems and federal management programs that remade forest landscapes as exclusionary sites of national and racial purity. Fusing fine-grained ethnography with insights gleaned from cultural studies and science studies, Kosek shows how the nationally beloved Smokey the Bear became a symbol of white racist colonialism for many Hispanos in the region, while Los Alamos National Laboratory, at once revered and reviled, remade regional ecologies and economies. <i>Understories</i> offers an innovative vision of environmental politics, one that challenges scholars as well as activists to radically rework their understandings of relations between nature, justice, and identity.</p></p><p>&#34;This theoretically and methodologically innovative study of how environmental politics shape and are shaped by race, class, and nationalism in the Southwest will make an important contribution to environmental anthropology and history as well as to border studies for years to come.

Introducing idealistic Western youth to the possibilities inherent in spiritual development, Ram Dass inspired a generation to turn on and tune in to a reality far different from the one they had known.</p><p>From the spring of 1970 until Maharajji died on September 11, 1973, several hundred Westerners had his darshan (in Hinduism, the beholding of a deity, revered person, or sacred object). Those who saw him formed the Maharajji satsang&#x2014;fellow travelers on the path. <em>Love Everyone</em> tells the stories of those who heard the siren call of the East and followed it to the foothills of the Himalayas. The ways they were called to make the journey, their experiences along the way, and their meeting with Maharajji form the core of this multicultural adventure in shifting consciousness.</p><p>The contributors share their recollections of Maharajji and how his wisdom shaped their lives. All have attempted to follow Maharajji&#x2019;s basic teaching, his seemingly simple directives: Love everyone, feed everyone, and remember God. All have found their own way to be of service in the world and, in so doing, have collectively touched the hearts and souls of countless others.</p></p><p><p>A celebration of one of the most influential spiritual leaders of our time: Neem Karoli Baba, the enlightened guru who inspired a generation of seekers&#x2014;including Ram Dass, Daniel Goleman, and Larry Brilliant&#x2014;on life-altering journeys that helped change the world.</p><p>In 1967, Ram Dass returned to the West from India and spread the teachings of his mysterious guru, Neem Karoli Baba, better known as Maharajji. Ram Dass&#x2019;s words about Maharajji&#x2019;s life-affirming wisdom resonated with a youth culture that had grown disillusioned with the violence, civil discord, and crude materialism of modern civilization. Hundreds of Westerners traveled to India and experienced Maharajji&#x2019;s extraordinary presence directly until his death in 1973. His simple directives&#x2014;love everyone, feed everyone, and remember God&#x2014;opened their hearts and awakened their souls.</p><p>What these followers brought back to the West has since changed the landscape of everyday life. Meditation is now mainstream; yoga studios are in every town; and mindfulness is practiced in elementary schools and board-rooms everywhere, from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill. A stirring piece of history, <em>Love Everyone</em> brings these stories to life, sharing for the first time the inspiring tales of the men and women who followed the siren call of the East to the foothills of the Himalayas, then returned to forever reshape the world.</p><p>A compelling and inspiring tribute to Maharajji from the Western men and women who knew him best, <em>Love Everyone</em> is a profound teaching on the power of love, as lasting and transformative as the truth, wisdom, and bliss of Maharajji.</p><p><strong>PARVATI MARKUS</strong> is a developmental editor and writer of spiritually oriented nonfiction books and memoirs.

The refrain 'Remember Salem!' was invoked frequently over the ensuing centuries. As time passed, the trials became a milepost measuring the distance America had progressed from its colonial past, its victims now the righteous and their persecutors the shamed. Yet the story of witchcraft did not end as the American Enlightenment dawned - a new, long, and chilling chapter was about to begin. <br><br>Witchcraft after Salem was not just a story of fire-side tales, legends, and superstitions: it continued to be a matter of life and death, souring the American dream for many. We know of more people killed as witches between 1692 and the 1950s than were executed before it. Witches were part of the story of the decimation of the Native Americans, the experience of slavery and emancipation, and the immigrant experience; they were embedded in the religious and social history of the country. Yet the history of American witchcraft between the eighteenth and the twentieth century also tells a less traumatic story, one that shows how different cultures interacted and shaped each other's languages and beliefs. <br><br>This is therefore much more than the tale of one persecuted community: it opens a fascinating window on the fears, prejudices, hopes, and dreams of the American people as their country rose from colony to superpower.<br></p><p><br><strong>Owen Davies</strong> is Professor of Social History at the University of Hertfordshire.

It extends Davies's reputation as an original thinker in the field, when so much work is derivative or merely illustrative of well-established ideas."--Malcolm Gaskill, <em>Fortean Times</em><p></p><br>"Davies's catholic approach has produced a volume densely packed with fascinating material. Along with detailed excurses into folklore--there are sustained discussions of hairballs, hag-riding, and skin shedding--the author presents a trove of historical anecdotes and case studies drawn from his wide research into local histories, obscure newspapers, and other neglected byways."--<em>Nova Religio</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Iron Heel</h2><p>The Iron Heel is a dystopian novel by American writer Jack London, first published in 1908. Generally considered to be &#34;the earliest of the modern Dystopian&#34;, it chronicles the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States. It is arguably the novel in which Jack London&#39;s socialist views are most explicitly on display. A forerunner of soft science fiction novels and stories of the 1960s and &#39;70s, the book stresses future changes in society and politics while paying much less attention to technological changes.[citation needed] The book is unusual among London&#39;s writings (and in the literature of the time in general) in being a first-person narrative of a woman protagonist written by a man. Much of the narrative is set in the San Francisco Bay Area, including events in San Francisco and Sonoma County.</p><p>John Griffith London (born John Griffith Chaney) was an American author, journalist, and social activist who lived from 1876 to 1916. His works, all fiction, were always founded in some fact or idea which he then conveyed, making his books full of double meaning and offering deeper understanding for those able to see it.</p><h2>Nahum: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)</h2><p><p><b>This volume demonstrates the intricate literary structure and high poetic quality of the book of Nahum and represents a significant break-through in the study of Hebrew prosody with important implications for understanding the formation of the canon of the Hebrew Bible.</b><br><br> This volume represents a significant breakthrough in the study of Hebrew prosody with important implications for understanding the formation of the canon of the Hebrew Bible. Duane Christensen, a renowned biblical scholar, offers a detailed analysis of the Hebrew text of Nahum and demonstrates the intricate literary structure and high poetic quality of the work.</p><p>Nahum is a book about God&#x2019;s justice and portrays God as strong, unyielding, and capable of great anger. This view of God&#x2019;s nature stands in contrast to that found in Jonah, another book in the section of the Hebrew Bible known as the Book of the Twelve Prophets, which presents God as &#x201c;compassionate, gracious . . . [and] abounding in steadfast love.&#x201d; Christensen shows how Nahum and Jonah present complementary aspects of God&#x2019;s nature, each essential for an understanding of the divine being.

Although Kafka seemed to consider <i>The Castle</i> a failure, critics, in wrestling with its enigmatic meaning, have recognized it as one of the great novels of our century. <br><br>Unfinished at Kafka's death in 1924, the manuscript of <i>The Castle</i> was edited for publication by Kafka's friend and literary executor, Max Brod. Both Brod's edition and the English-language translation of it that was prepared by Willa and Edwin Muir in 1930 have long been considered flawed.<br><br>This new edition of Kafka's terrifying and comic masterpiece is the product of an international team of experts who went back to Kafka's original manuscript and notes to create an edition that is as close as possible to the way the author left it. The <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> hailed their work, saying that it will "decisively alter our understanding of Kafka and render previous editions obsolete."<br><br>Mark Harman's brilliant translation closely follows the fluidity and breathlessness of the sparsely punctuated original manuscript, revealing levels of comedy, energy, and visual power that have not been previously accessible to <br>English-language readers.<br><br>W. H. Auden likened Kafka to Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe as the single most important writer of his age. Here, in this new edition, is a Kafka for the twenty-first century.</p><p>They are perhaps the most famous literary instructions never followed: "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread...." Thankfully, Max Brod did not honor his friend Franz Kafka's final wishes. Instead, he did everything within his power to ensure that Kafka's work would find publication--including making some sweeping changes in the original texts. Until recently, the world has known only Brod's version of Kafka, with its altered punctuation, word order, and chapter divisions. Restoring much of what had previously been expunged, as well as the fluid, oral quality of Kafka's original German, Mark Harman's new translation of <i>The Castle</i> is a major literary event. <p> One of three unfinished novels left after Kafka's death, <i>The Castle</i> is in many ways the writer's most enduring and influential work. In Harman's muscular translation, Kafka's text seems more modern than ever, the words tumbling over one another, the sentences separated only by commas. Harman's version also ends the same way as Kafka's original manuscript--that is, in mid-sentence: "She held out her trembling hand to K. and had him sit down beside her, she spoke with great difficulty, it was difficult to understand her, but what she said--." For anyone used to reading Kafka in his artificially complete form, the effect is extraordinary; it is as if Kafka himself had just stepped from the room, leaving behind him a work whose resolution is the more haunting for being forever out of reach.</p>"The new Schocken edition of <i>The Castle</i> represents a major and long-awaited event in English-language publishing. It is a wonderful piece of news for all Kafka readers who, for more than half a century, have had to rely on flawed, superannuated editions. Mark Harman is to be commended for his success in capturing the fresh, fluid, almost breathless style of Kafka's original manuscript, which leaves the reader hanging in mid-sentence." <br>--Mark M. Anderson, Columbia University<p><i>"The Castle,</i> published here for the first time in 1930, was the first Kafka to arrive in America. After the war, Hannah Arendt remarked that The Castle might finally be comprehensible to the generation of the forties, who had had the occasion to watch their world become Kafkaesque. What will the generation of the nineties make of <i>The Castle,</i> now that its full message has arrived? Here is the masterpiece behind the masterpiece."<br>--Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, Haverford College</p><p>"Sparkles with comedy, with zest, and with a fresh visual power, which in the Muir translation were indistinct or lost. This is not just a new, brilliantly insightful, sensitive, and stylish translation, it is a new <i>Castle,</i> and it is a pleasure to read."<br>--Christopher Middleton, University of Texas at Austin</p><p>"This is the closest to Kafka's original novel and intention that any translation could get, and what is more, it is eminently readable. With this exceptional translation, the time for a new Kafka in English has finally come." <br>--Egon Schwartz, Washington University, St. Louis</p></p><h2>Experiencing Choral Music, Beginning Sight-Singing (EXPERIENCING CHORAL MUSIC BEGINNING SE)</h2><p><b>A COMPREHENSIVE CHORAL METHOD DEVELOPED BY HAL LEONARD CORPORATION FOR GRADES 6-12.</b> <p> </p><ul> <li><b>NEW MUSIC</b> </li><li><b>NEW FORMAT</b> </li><li><b>NEW SIGHT-SINGING MATERIALS</b> <br> <br> Sight-Singing Books for each level present a sequential approach to musical literacy and are directly correlated to the <i>Mixed Voices, Treble Voices,</i> and <i>Tenor/Bass Voices</i> textbooks.

The stated purpose of the SAT Latin Subject Test is to evaluate your ability to read Latin. Because the test evaluates your mastery of the mechanics of reading Latin, with special emphasis on grammar and syntax, the majority of the presentations in this book are devoted to helping you review Latin forms and their uses. These sections are therefore organized according to the parts of speech recommended for review by the College Board, namely, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs:<br>Section 1: The Basics<br>Section 2: Nouns<br>Section 3: Pronouns<br>Section 4: Adjectives and Adverbs<br>Section 5: Indicative Verbs<br>Section 6: Imperative Verbs<br>Section 7: Verbals<br>Section 8: Subjunctive Verbs<br>Section 9: Special Aspects of the SAT Latin Subject Test<br>Section 10: Practice Tests<br><br>Most chapters begin with a reference chart of Latin forms (everyone's favorite!), which is accompanied by a brief discussion of the most common uses of these forms. In these presentations, alternative nomenclature is provided when forms or uses are labeled or described; for example, purpose clauses are also referred to as final clauses. Traditional terms, such as "passive periphrastic," are used for convenience. Glossaries of terms are included at appropriate points in this book, but by no means should this suggest that you will be tested on terminology, which is simply a means to the end of reading and understanding Latin, and not an end in itself.<br><br>The presentations in each chapter have been designed to supplement your preparation, whether you have learned Latin using the grammar-translation method (e.g., Amsco's Lingua Latina, "Jenney" First Year Latin and Second Year Latin, Latin for Americans, Our Latin Heritage) or the reading-based method (e.g., The Cambridge Latin Course, Ecce Romani, The Oxford Latin Course). Use this review guide to supplement the text from which you learned Latin because the latter is the resource with which you will be most familiar. Illustrative Latin sentences with English translations are provided to support the presentations in each chapter.

Tristram ShandyIntroduction and Notes by Robert Folkenflik <p>Rich in playful double entendres, digressions, formal oddities, and typographical experiments, "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman provoked a literary sensation when it first appeared in England in a series of volumes from 1759 to 1767. An ingeniously structured novel (about writing a novel) that fascinates like a verbal game of chess, "Tristram Shandy is the most protean and playful English novel of the eighteenth century and a celebration of the art of fiction; its inventiveness anticipates the work of Joyce, Rushdie, and Fuentes in our own century. This Modern Library Paperback is set from the nine-volume first edition from 1759.</p></p><h2>Basic Legal Research Workbook (Aspen Coursebook)</h2><p><p>With a balance of online and traditional print sources, the Fifth Edition of BASIC LEGAL&nbsp;RESEARCH WORKBOOK encourages independent, experiential learning.

Informed by wide clinical experience, and written with the author&#39;s well known humanity and lucidity, taken together, the lectures provide an invaluable introduction to John Bowlby&#39;s thought and work. In addition to the basic principles with which they are mainly concerned, they also contain much practical guidance of use both to parents and to members of the mental health professions.</p><p><strong>Dr John Bowlby</strong> (1907-1990) was the father of Attachment Theory. He worked for many years as Child and Family Psychiatrist at the Tavistock Clinic, London, and became internationally reknowned for his writings in the area of child psychiatry.<strong>'These essays, spanning twenty years of Bowlby's speaking about the forming and breaking of relationships of affection, are clear and systematic ... They make an excellent introduction to his thought.'</strong> <em>- British Journal of Psychiatry</em></p><h2>The Gilded Edge: The Art of the Frame</h2><p>Nothing enhances the appeal of a beautiful painting like the perfect frame. Indeed, framing is an art form in its own right, and <i>The Gilded Edge</i> is the first book to offer a comprehensive visual survey of the beautiful antique frames made in America over the last two centuries. Comprising diverse essays by art world luminaries, museum curators, private collectors, and independent scholars, this richly illustrated volume covers topics ranging from frame history and fabrication to the art of perfectly matching frame to artwork. Unlike most art books that depict paintings without their frames, <i>The Gilded Edge</i> presents a plethora of photographs that showcase frames in relation to the paintings they border&#x2014;and as works of art themselves. An accessible reference for collectors and admirers alike, this is an invaluable guide to the art of making beautiful things even more so.</p><p>Eli Wilner owns Eli Wilner &amp; Company, a Manhattan business that recently took on the framing of 27 American paintings in the White House collection.It's a frame-up! New York frame dealer and restorer Wilner has compiled an elegant and substantial book of words and images about the history and aesthetics of the rectangular things that go around paintings, with a tight focus on American art. Though often neglected by professional critics, frames have played many roles in shaping the look and feel of paintings, restricting or opening up the visual and cultural fields in which paintings appear. Painters like James McNeill Whistler put care and attention to making their frames themselves; designers and craftspeople from other media, like the architect Stanford White, also created significant picture frames. After a quick introduction by Wilner himself, 10 essaysAby curators, academic art historians and practicing framersAintroduce readers to picture frames' past and their present; 175 plates (many in color) show, sometimes just frames, sometimes paintings in frames, and make the book a pleasure to leaf through. Framer Suzanne Smeaton discusses the frames designed by painters, furnishing many beautiful full-page examples: Florine Stettheimer's white-and-gold, carved-and-gilded setting for her Beauty Contest simulates curtains at a fancy theater, while Georgia O'Keeffe's scalloped metal frame for her Ram's Head sheathes the painting's loud browns in a quieter black. Princeton art historian Sally Mills's essay "From Parlors to Pueblos" shows, with examples from Remington, Church and others, how "the diversity of western frames parallels the diversity found in western paintings." Metropolitan Museum of Art associate curator Carrie Rebora Barratt shows how the Met has kept track of its frames, corrected framing mistakes and gleaned information about painters' own choices, with particular attention to 19th-century realist painter Thomas Eakins. Appendixes include a glossary of frame types, terms and ornamentation. American frames became collectible in their own right, and a subject of special art historical attention, only about 20 years ago: this hefty and attractive volume shows how far the study of frames has already come.

Addressing the composition and operation of the SAS macro facility and the SAS macro language, Carpenter&#39;s Complete Guide to the SAS Macro Language, Second Edition, is filled with ready-to-use macros, macro functions, and macro tools that will enable you to effortlessly convert SAS code to macros, define macro variables, and more! New topics include writing user interfaces with %WINDOW, using SYSPARM and SYSPBUFF, using CALL EXECUTE, deleting macro variables using %SYMDEL, using macro recursion, and creating your own macro functions. Also included are new SAS(r) 9 features such as statements that include %ABORT and %RETURN, system options for the macro language, macro functions, autocall library macros, and code recovery options for compiled stored macro libraries. Many topics from the first edition have been expanded. Whether you&#39;re a new user with a basic understanding of Base SAS or an experienced programmer in need of an advanced reference manual, this is the macro book you&#39;ve been searching for!</p><p>Art Carpenter, an independent consultant and statistician, has been a SAS user since the mid-1970s. He provides training and instruction on the SAS macro language and other SAS topics to SAS users nationwide. In addition to being the general editor of the Art Carpenter SAS Software Series, his impressive list of publications includes Annotate: Simply the Basics, his co-authored Quick Results with SAS/GRAPH Software, two chapters in Reporting from the Field, and over four dozen papers and posters presented at the SAS Users Group International (SUGI) conference and various regional and international SAS Users Group conferences. <p>Art has served as a steering committee chairperson of both the Southern California SAS Users Group (SoCalSUG) and the San Diego SAS Users Group (SANDS) conferences. He has also served as a conference co-chair of the Western Users of SAS Software (WUSS) conference, and conference chair and Executive Board member at SUGI.</p>Art Carpenter has been hard at work since his first edition was published in 1998. He has added enough new material to double the size of his original work. Many more complex ideas of macro usage are illustrated here, with diverse topics brought together and discussed as whole concepts. I would recommend this book to beginners as well as advanced programmers who wish to be proficient in their usage of the simple yet powerful SAS macro language. --Ronald Fehd, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<br><br>Art has once again written a fantastic SAS book. It is very complete in its coverage of the macro language, covering everything from the basics to advanced topics. It makes an excellent reference book with its clear layout. I would highly recommend it particularly to experienced SAS programmers who want a complete macro reference which extends to cover advanced topics. I wrote the "Advanced Macro Programming" course for SAS UK, and this would make a perfect companion to that course. In short, it's a fantastic book and contains plenty of new material compared to his first. It will surely pay for itself in no time. --Philip Mason, Wood Street Consultants<br><br>Having used SAS for 25 plus years, I can honestly say I am always amazed at what I learn from reading SAS Press titles and the little things I may have overlooked or forgotten. Art did an excellent job writing this book with plenty of good examples and well-documented bullets and callouts of each step within his examples. He has also included a number of good macros that could be used by any SAS developer and incorporate them into their library of tools. This is a must-have book for the serious SAS developer who wishes to use and learn the SAS macro language. --Charles Patridge, The Hartford Financial Service</p><h2>Proposal Writing: Effective Grantsmanship (SAGE Sourcebooks for the Human Services)</h2><p>Clear, easy-to-understand, and jargon-free, this updated <strong>Fourth Edition </strong>of <strong><em>Proposal Writing: Effective Grantsmanship</em></strong> offers a step-by-step guide to writing a successful grant proposal to meet community needs.

The only problem? The Ministry of Culture must approve the script before they can get rolling. That, and they can&#x2019;t figure out how to turn on the camera.<br><br>Meanwhile, the skeleton of a woman has appeared under the Anusawari Arch in the middle of the night. Siri puts his directorial debut on hold and assists his friend Phosy, the newly promoted Senior Police Inspector, with the ensuing investigation. Though the death of the unknown woman seems to be recent, the flesh on her corpse has been picked off in places as if something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;has been gnawing on the bones. The plot Siri and his friends uncover involves much more than a single set of skeletal remains.</p><p><b>Colin Cotterill</b> is the author of twelve other books in the Dr. Siri Paiboun series:<i> The Coroner&#x2019;s Lunch</i>,<i> Thirty-Three Teeth</i>,<i> Disco for the Departed</i>, <i>Anarchy and Old Dogs</i>, <i>Curse of the Pogo Stick</i>, <i>The Merry Misogynist</i>, <i>Love Songs from a Shallow Grave</i>, <i>Slash and Burn</i>, <i>The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Die</i>, <i>Six and a Half Deadly Sins</i>, <i>I Shot the Buddha</i>, and <i>The Rat Catchers&#x2019; Olympics</i>.

She was in a crate. A compact coconut wood coffin with narrow slits for air. She&#x2019;d screamed over and over to no avail. She&#x2019;d tried to make sense of it. She&#x2019;d counted the unblinking eyes. Nineteen of them. One eye too many or one too few, but nineteen by every reckoning. And even though there was no light beneath the thick tarpaulin those eyes glowed deep yellow like dying stars.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When she came around that last time she thought she was still in the nightmare and in a way she was. Her knees were tucked up tightly against her chest and there was no more than a shoebox of space at the foot of the crate, but the creatures&#x2014;the nineteen-eyed creatures&#x2014;had contracted somehow and packed themselves together so closely there would be no contact with her. Not yet. She could feel their hot breaths against her bare toes. She could hear the wheezing in their throats. But they stared at her, unmoving, waiting for her to lose consciousness again because it was inevitable she would. They would bide their time until she had no more fight in her. Then, and only then, they would devour her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter Two</b><br> <b>The Smugglers</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Life sped by in Vientiane like a Volkswagen van on blocks. The streets were crusty with red dust, the uneven sidewalks sprouted half-hearted weeds, and the people neither smiled nor raised their voices for fear of drawing attention to themselves. You could never be sure who was listening. They all knew of someone who&#x2019;d fled the country and at least one person who&#x2019;d disappeared. Many had relatives in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border. Many more had ambitions or dreams or plans to join them but lacked the spunk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This was year five of a socialist experiment that had failed the People&#x2019;s Democratic Republic of Laos in many ways. The Communist vessel was holed and on its way down. The rice collectives program had collapsed. Government workers went unpaid for months. And Thailand had once more closed its Mekhong border due to pissy spats over trespassing and accusations of insurgencies, and, never forget, good old historical animosity. The river guard patrols on both banks had been doubled, but it was a vast river and still the midnight rafts of smuggled Thai goods floated diagonally north on the current, crisscrossing disgruntled Lao heading south on their rubber inner tubes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it was a surprise to many on one humid night in August when two elderly Lao gentlemen were spotted paddling their bamboo raft in a northerly direction toward the country everyone wanted to leave. They were dressed in ninja black, but their grumbling and coughing destroyed any pretense of stealth. Between them was a balding cross-eyed hound and a mysterious large object wrapped in a nylon parachute. The latter was roughly the size and shape of a grenade launcher and would certainly have led to the old boys&#x2019; being shot on sight if they were discovered. Smuggling weapons of war was not a wise pastime for men in their seventies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Did they not teach you to row?&#x201d; asked Dr. Siri, the stockier of the two.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I was a politician,&#x201d; Comrade Civilai replied. &#x201c;They only taught us how to bail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then that explains why we&#x2019;re going around in circles,&#x201d; said Siri.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The river ran high and fast at the end of the rains, and the current would have taken them far beyond Vientiane if they didn&#x2019;t lean into it with some enthusiasm. But paddling always appeared easier than it was, especially with a heavy cargo. From somewhere to the north they heard the crack of a river guard&#x2019;s rifle but no accompanying scream. Neither the rifles nor the men who bore them had any accuracy. The old boys were not intimidated by the sound because they knew how little chance there was of being hit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And going around in circles would aptly describe the direction of our policies these past five years,&#x201d; said Civilai, mostly to himself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Save your breath for a final push,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s our signal. We don&#x2019;t want to overshoot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the dense foliage ahead, two lights&#x2014;one white, one red&#x2014;flashed intermittently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;My heart can&#x2019;t take this,&#x201d; said Comrade Civilai.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then rest your organs and put your back into it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All at once they seemed to be surfing the current rather than fighting it. They gathered speed, charging toward the lights. Remarkably, they had timed their trajectory perfectly but not their velocity. Theirs was not a dignified landing. Ugly the dog, sensing danger, abandoned the vessel five meters from the bank and swam home. The corner of the raft snagged in a tree root so the vessel spun around and hit the bank at speed and in reverse. Dr. Siri was thrown to the deck. There was a loud thump when his head hit the bamboo, but his was a hard head. Civilai wasn&#x2019;t so lucky. He was jettisoned head first into the river mud where he sank immediately until only his legs were visible. To his credit he did not kick or wave them pathetically. They merely jutted heavenward like a victory sign. He was rescued by the reception committee. Mr. Geung and Madam Daeng took a leg each and yanked him out of the mire. He emerged with a slurping sound like a large snail being pulled reluctantly from its shell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well that all worked out quite well,&#x201d; said Siri.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The next day, Chief Inspector Phosy arrived at Madam Daeng&#x2019;s noodle shop shortly after the morning rush.<br> There were never enough stools to accommodate all the customers who traveled out of their way to eat the best homemade <i>feu </i>noodles in the country. Madam Daeng, never satisfied with shop-bought noodles, had taken to making her own beneath a corrugated tin roof behind the shop. Yet despite all the personal touches and time and effort the woman put into her dishes, and in the face of much criticism from her husband, she refused to increase the prices.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The poor . . .&#x201d; she would say, &#x201c;. . . have as much right to eat food of quality as do the more advantaged.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the drivers of the black Zil limousines used by the senior Party members had to wait their turn to be served. Their bosses thought they might add a few extra kip as an incentive to jump the queue, but Madam Daeng would have nothing of it. Comrade Civilai often said that hers was the only example of functioning Communism in the republic. She replied that there was nothing political about it. She was just being fair.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is he in?&#x201d; the chief inspector asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam Daeng saw a familiar scowl on his good-looking face. Since his promotion to chief inspector two months earlier, Phosy had discovered a lot to scowl about. Many members of the central committee considered him too young at forty-six to have been handed such responsibility. But Madam Daeng, twenty years his senior, knew there was nobody more qualified or able to take on the role. She left Mr. Geung to clean the noodle tubs and walked slowly over to the policeman.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very well, thank you, Chief Inspector,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam Daeng had been a freedom fighter in the clandestine war against the French imperialists, and she was well aware that she still intimidated even the most confident of men. In fact, her short shock of snow white hair and her piercing hazelnut-colored eyes gave her even more of an advantage. Phosy stood no chance.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Daeng,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It just seems that your husband is intent on making my impossible job even more impossible.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;My goodness, what&#x2019;s he done now?&#x201d; asked Daeng.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poured the policeman a glass of iced tea and they sat at a table overlooking the river.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed. &#x201c;You know very well,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What kind of policeman would assume a wife knew every move her husband made?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;One who knew she was an accomplice in a criminal act?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They drank their sweet tea and watched Ugly the dog at the river&#x2019;s edge catching crabs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m offended,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You need to work on that inscrutability, Daeng. Not convincing at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And what particular crime am I accused of accomplicing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start with smuggling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, Phosy. Smuggling? Really? Twenty years ago that would have been called foraging. Nothing to eat in the village so you head off into the jungle and return with enough game to feed the family. Laos is being slowly starved to death by the Thai embargos, so it&#x2019;s only natural her inhabitants would forage.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Foraging across a national border is called smuggling,&#x201d; said Phosy. &#x201c;And if Siri had merely been paddling back from Si Chiang Mai with beans and roast pig I wouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then why are you here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We have an eye-witness account of Dr. Siri and Comrade Civilai importing weapons.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She chuckled. &#x201c;And what witness would that eye belong to?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not at liberty to say.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course you are. Until they get around to finishing the constitution we won&#x2019;t have any laws to speak of. Your liberty to say is arbitrary.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phosy sipped his tea and followed the progress of a cloud. &#x201c;A river guard,&#x201d; he said at last.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A river guard saw Dr. Siri importing weapons?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then why didn&#x2019;t he shoot him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t the river guard shoot Dr. Siri and his accomplices and be done with it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s delicate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Would it be because the river guards have splendid weapons produced in the Soviet Union but that for the past three months, due to some blip in the paperwork, none of them has been issued with ammunition? That in the event of seeing a suspicious craft on the river, our guards have been instructed to set dry bamboo tubes alight because that explosion makes a similar sound to the firing of a rifle and it may just discourage smugglers? The guards do however have marvelous flashlights and permission to shine the beam on suspicious objects. None so far has been silly enough to do such a thing. Thai smugglers are invariably armed and it would be suicidal. Therefore, no river guard on a cloudy night would have the faintest idea that Dr. Siri&#x2014;if he even were to be on the river&#x2014;might or might not be smuggling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phosy put down his glass. &#x201c;He recognized all of you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He even identified the dog. He was in a tree not far from your reception committee. He&#x2019;s a regular customer here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then he should be ashamed of himself,&#x201d; said Daeng. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s become of loyalty to one&#x2019;s noodle shop?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Daeng . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We often go for a little paddle and a frolic of a night when it&#x2019;s too hot to sleep. Mistaken identity, no doubt. I&#x2019;ll have a word with him. What&#x2019;s his name?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Daeng.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What was on the raft?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There. That&#x2019;s the first thing the old Inspector Phosy would have asked. This new chief inspector&#x2019;s already tangled up in words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And if I had asked that question sooner I wouldn&#x2019;t have learned what classified information you have regarding our river guards, would I?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Damn, you got me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So, what was on the raft?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Real Price of Everything: Rediscovering the Six Classics of Economics</h2><p>In his <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Liar&#x2019;s Poker</i> and<i> Moneyball</i>, Michael Lewis gave us an unprecedented look at what goes on behind the scenes on Wall Street.

With their distinctive colors, thoughtful compositions, and narrative, these miniature creations reveal the emergence and continuity of the artist&#x2019;s approach to her work. Internationally recognized for her mastery of a textile vocabulary of extremely different scales&#x2015;sculpture, tapestry, site specific commissions for public spaces, environments of recuperated clothing and uniforms, and more&#x2015;Hicks has thoughtfully crafted miniatures throughout her nomadic career. The palm-sized works present a record of her remarkable&nbsp;and personal journeys.<br>Focusing on some one hundred&nbsp;miniatures from&nbsp;public and private collections, the book demonstrates the breadth of Hicks's concerns: her persistent inquiry into the mysteries of color, her playful yet reverential subversions of weaving traditions, her surprising range of materials, and her exploration of&nbsp;new technology. From initial experiments based on pre-Columbian weaving structures to a 2005 sculptural project using ninety colors of synthetic filaments, these small works offer a unique opportunity to access and examine the artist's conceptual and technical forays.

'Legislative Theatre' is an attempt to use Boal's method of 'Forum Theatre' within a political system to create a truer form of democracy. It is an extraordinary experiment in the potential of theatre to affect social change.<br> At the heart of his method of Forum Theatre is the dual meaning of the verb 'to act': to perform and to take action. Forum Theatre invites members of the audience to take the stage and decide the outcome, becoming an integral part of the performance. As a politician in his native Rio de Janeiro, Boal used Forum Theatre to motivate the local populace in generating relevant legislation. In <em>Legislative Theatre</em> Boal creates new, theatrical, and truly revolutionary ways of involving everyone in the democratic process.<br> This book includes:<br> * a full explanation of the genesis and principles of Legislative Theatre<br> * a description of the process in operation in Rio<br> * Boal's essays, speeches and lectures on popular theatre, Paolo Freire, cultural activism, the point of playwrighting, and much else besides.</p><p>Augusto Boal is a Brazilian dramaturg, theorist, writer, teacher, and politician.

Balancing social and cultural history with traditional political and diplomatic themes, it tells the story of the diversity and complexity of the United States and the forces that have enabled it to survive and flourish despite division. Volume 2 covers 1865 to the present. This fifth edition features six new essays and enhanced coverage of recent events and developments in the continuing American story.</p><p></p><h2>Spectacular Wickedness: Sex, Race, and Memory in Storyville, New Orleans</h2><p><p>From 1897 to 1917 the red-light district of Storyville commercialized and even thrived on New Orleans's longstanding reputation for sin and sexual excess. This notorious neighborhood, located just outside of the French Quarter, hosted a diverse cast of characters who reflected the cultural milieu and complex social structure of turn-of-the-century New Orleans, a city infamous for both prostitution and interracial intimacy. In particular, Lulu White&#x2015;a mixed-race prostitute and madam&#x2015;created an image of herself and marketed it profitably to sell sex with light-skinned women to white men of means. In Spectacular Wickedness, Emily Epstein Landau examines the social history of this famed district within the cultural context of developing racial, sexual, and gender ideologies and practices.</p><p>Storyville's founding was envisioned as a reform measure, an effort by the city's business elite to curb and contain prostitution&#x2015;namely, to segregate it. In 1890, the Louisiana legislature passed the Separate Car Act, which, when challenged by New Orleans's Creoles of color, led to the landmark Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896, constitutionally sanctioning the enactment of "separate but equal" laws. The concurrent partitioning of both prostitutes and blacks worked only to reinforce Storyville's libidinous license and turned sex across the color line into a more lucrative commodity. </p><p>By looking at prostitution through the lens of patriarchy and demonstrating how gendered racial ideologies proved crucial to the remaking of southern society in the aftermath of the Civil War, Landau reveals how Storyville's salacious and eccentric subculture played a significant role in the way New Orleans constructed itself during the New South era.</p></p><p>Emily Epstein Landau earned her Ph.D. in history at Yale University and teaches in the Department of History at the University of Maryland at College Park. She lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and two daughters."Landau's takedown of Storyville's place in the United States's creation myth proves relevant in a country that still doesn't know how to categorize this sea-level city of intersections."--Bitch Magazine<br><br>"Landau's attention to the different ways women of color moved through and used the space created by the Storyville precinct enriches understanding of gender, sexuality, and class formations among late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century African American women."--<i>The Journal of American History</i><br><br>"Well-researched and informative, Spectacular Wickedness is a welcome addition to the ever-growing canon of New Orleans cultural history books."--<i>New Orleans Advocate</i><br><br>."Landau has admirably demonstrated that the red-light district's notoriety was, and continues to be, premised on the exploitation of the city's reputation for racialized sexuality." --<i>The American Historical Review</i></p><h2>Technical Communication: A Practical Approach</h2><p><p>Emphasizing the connection between writing and context, <i>Technical Communication: A Practical Approach</i> 8e uses a fictional company (M-Global) and students' own school and workplace settings to introduce the common genres of technical communication.

Washington&#39;s incendiary classic is accompanied by a selection of authentic slave narratives and is published to coincide with Black History Month. In addition, the volume is enhanced by a rich mix of archival material from the Library&#39;s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.</p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Both collections are included in their entirety in this edition, which also contains other uncollected stories and a selection of posthumously published works that have become part of the Kafka canon.

The tales are among Kafka's best-known, haunting and compelling satires on the human condition, on art and artists, and on life itself, which complement his major fictions. Translated by the award-winning Joyce Crick, the book includes an invaluable introduction, notes, and other editorial material by renowned Kafka scholar Ritchie Robertson.

In Casement's lucid treatise, LEARNING FROM THE PATIENT, everything in psychoanalytic theory and technique is up for questioning and for careful testing in the clinical setting; every concept used is explained and illustrated with clinical examples. The author offers an unusual openness about what really happens in the consulting room, including mistakes his own as well as others'. The patient's unconscious contribution to analytic work is fully illustrated. As a result of this approach, insight is arrived at with a rare freshness as theory is rediscovered in the consulting room.<br></p><p>Patrick Casement is a training analyst of the British Psycho-Analytical Society. Having graduated in theology and anthropology at Cambridge, he worked for ten years as a social worker and qualified with the British Association of Psychotherapists before training to become a psychoanalyst. He is currently in full-time private practice. His first book, which comprises Part I of this volume, is well known throughout Europe and has achieved the status of a modern classic.<br>"...if I was asked to recommend one book on technique for the beginning therapist, I would recommend Learning from the Patient."--Psychoanalytic Psychology (<i>Psychoanalytic Psychology</i> 1992-09-27)<br><br>"The book contains a wealth of insights and ingenious ways of handling complex problems in a therapeutic relationship.

But it also offers a false dichotomy. Many Christian artists think that they must choose between their faith and their artistic calling. Drawing upon his experiences as both a Christian and a practicing artist, Cameron J. Anderson explores the dynamics of faith and art in this latest volume in IVP Academic's Studies in Theology and the Arts series. Tracing the relationship between evangelicalism and modern art in postwar America&#x2015;two entities that often found themselves at odds with each other&#x2015;Anderson raises several issues that confront artists. With skill, sensitivity and insight, he considers questions such as the role of our bodies and our senses in our experience of the arts, the relationship between text and image, the persistent dangers of idolatry, the possibility of pursuing God through an encounter with beauty and more. Throughout this study, Anderson's principal concern is how Christian artists can faithfully pursue their vocational calling in contemporary culture. Readers will find here not only an informed and thoughtful response, but also a vision that offers guidance and hope.</p><p>Cameron J. Anderson (MFA, Cranbrook Academy of Art) is an artist and the executive director of Christians in the Visual Arts (CIVA). Prior to joining CIVA, he served on the staff of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship for thirty years, most recently as the national director for graduate and faculty ministries. He lectures frequently on the arts, media, advertising and contemporary culture, and he coedited, with Sandra Bowden, <em>Faith and Vision: Twenty-Five Years of Christians in the Visual Arts</em>."Cam Anderson has read a lot of good books and that's part of what makes <em>this</em> book so rich and rewarding. But, far more importantly, this book represents a lifelong engagement with the arts and a deep faithfulness to Anderson's roots in the evangelical church. So this is a personal book in the best possible sense. It is, to quote Eugene Peterson, evidence of 'a long obedience in the same direction.'" (Gregory Wolfe, editor, Image)<br><br>"Cam Anderson's vision inspires, challenges and encourages me. He is wise about creativity, faithful about imagination and provocative about beauty. We are invited into a deeper humanity and a greater faithfulness to the Artist who made us. I am so grateful for this book and believe many other readers will be too!" (Mark Labberton, president, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This is a thoughtful, remarkable book that will help evangelical Christians face their history of shunning modern art. As a convinced follower of Jesus Christ, Anderson lovingly laments the past evangelical practice of pitting binary opposites against one another: soul against body, word against image, church ministry against being an artist. Anderson shows how the millennia of church history and a fresh biblical stance can overcome these polarities. Through his writing, which is extremely well researched and gives evidence of many years of wide reading, he convincingly shows how visual culture can be central to piety and how artistry is a worthy occupation for believers. This work is exciting, people friendly, deeply faithful and wise." (Calvin Seerveld, professor emeritus of philosophical aesthetics, Institute for Christian Studies, Toronto)<br><br>"From the perspective of his longtime dual residency in both the modern art world and the evangelical church, my good friend Cam Anderson is uniquely qualified to lead evangelicals and artists to understand and love one another. As I encountered a wide range of modern art in his book (Manet, Monet, Newman, Rothko, Warhol, Pollock and many others) I experienced a sense of wonder at the power and elegance of work that I had not noticed or appreciated before. For Christians seeking an aesthetic adventure in the modern art world and for Christian artists working to fulfill their God-given vocation, this book provides excellent guidance from one who is a faithful Christian and a gifted artist." (Walter Hansen, professor emeritus of New Testament interpretation, Fuller Theological Seminary, author of commentaries on the New Testament, coauthor of Through Your Eyes)<br><br>"Cam Anderson's <em>The Faithful Artist</em> is the most probing analysis ever written on the roots of the negative attitude of twentieth-century evangelicals toward the visual arts. Anderson knows evangelicalism from the inside. What greatly enhances his analysis is that it is set within the context of a broad, deep and sympathetic understanding of developments in the world of the visual arts in the twentieth century. The book reaches its climax with an eloquent, biblically based appeal to evangelicals to engage the visual arts, both as creators and as viewers. We have needed this very book for a long time." (Nicholas Wolterstorff, Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology, Yale University, senior research fellow, Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, University of Virginia, honorary research professor, Australian Catholic University)<br><br>"In <em>The Faithful Artist</em> Cam Anderson extends an intellectual welcome to readers who may feel that modern and contemporary art are an exclusive party, a private conversation for an artistic elite. By skillfully unpacking cultural factors leading to the modernist rejection of traditional artistic forms, he reveals some of the reasons for art's estrangement from educated laypersons. Anderson then clarifies for Christians why art still matters in the midst of tensions between traditional religious belief and modern aesthetic sensibility&#x2015;issuing a compelling call for artists to rediscover their accountability and calling within the body of Christ, broken afresh for the life of the world. Additionally he makes a vital argument for why the church needs art and artists, providing genuine answers for how these might once again find their way into healthy communion with one another." (Bruce Herman, Lothl�rien Distinguished Chair in Fine Arts, Gordon College)<br><br>"In this detailed overview and synthesis, Cameron Anderson opens up the mysteries of contemporary art, describing how works of art may operate as lenses through which to view the seen and unseen within culture. This illuminating book allows the double foci on faith and art to converge, introducing us to the worldview of the Ultimate Artist." (Luci Shaw, poet, writer in residence, Regent College, author of Thumbprint in the Clay)<br><br>"An engaging and carefully researched summation of where Christian faith and visual art have been and where they may be headed. Artists are invited to take a seat at a wedding feast where binary opposition withers and an enriched complexity emerges. Observing how conviction and restless longing coexist in 'the faithful artist,' Anderson sets out to illuminate a way forward."

These strategic and more tactical issues are examined for a broad spectrum of retailers, both large and small, domestic and international, selling both merchandise and services. In preparing this edition, the authors focused on five important factors that continue to delineate outstanding retailers: -The use of big data and analytical methods for decision making.-The application of social media and mobile for communicating with customers and enhancing their shopping experience.-The issues involved in utilizing a mobile channel and providing a seamless multi-channel experience for customers.-The engagement in the overarching emphasis on conscious marketing and corporate social responsibility when making business decisions.-The impact of globalization on the retail industry.</p><p></p><h2>A History of Ancient Egypt</h2><p>A reign-by-reign history of ancient Egypt traces the rise and fall of civilization in the Nile Valley from the first human settlement to the conquest of Alexander the Great</p><p>This is an account of the rise and fall of the civilization in the Nile Valley, covering the first human settlement (c. 120,000 BC) to its conquest by Alexander the Great in 333 BC. It is the first reign-by-reign history of ancient Egypt to be published since Sir Alan Gardiner's <i>Egypt of the Pharaohs</i> (1961) and takes full account of the many archaeological, scientific and linguistic discoveries of the last three decades. The author blends archaeological and textual evidence into a lucid and vivid narrative and, by quoting extensively from contemporary sources, such as the funerary autobiographies of individuals and the official accounts of military campaigns, adds a strong sense of atmosphere to the unfolding of events.<br> <p>Nicolas Grimal recounts the political, cultural and economic history of the Egyptians within the framework of an intricate and well-argued chronology. At a time when the vast accumulation of information from ancient Egypt is becoming almost too diverse for a single mind to encompass, he has managed to transform - without disguising current gaps in knowledge - disparate sources of evidence and the findings of many different disciplines into a coherent historical sequence. This is in itself a considerable achievement: it has also provided the means of presenting one of the most scholarly and at the same time most readable histories ever written of a civilization whose mysteries and achievements have fascinated the West for well over two millennia.<br> </p> <p>For the paperback edition a section of further reading in English has been prepared by Kent R.

Time is a central concern for Proust, appearing first in the title and last as the final word of the novel. What is his vision of the past? Does he have a vision of the present? The future? Can the Narrator be said to be living in the past? Is he like the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass , with &#39;jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today&#39;? 2. The renowned translator of Proust, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, originally grouped the opening section of In Search of Lost Time under the title &#39;The Overture,&#39; which includes two famous passages, the good night kiss and the evocative taste of the madeleine. Does this seem apt? If so, how might this fifty-odd page beginning prefigure what will transpire later? What would you expect to follow, given that an overture usually introduces the main themes of a musical work? What does it suggest about Proust&#39;s conception of literature and music? 3. The episode of the good night kiss strikes some readers as odd or contradictory: the Narrator&#39;s need for a kiss seems almost infantile, while his power of observation seems extraordinarily precocious. Considering that he is sent to bed at eight o&#39;clock, how old do you think the Narrator is? Is it significant that his father suggests the Narrator be given the kiss he craves, whereas his mother is reluctant, saying &#39;We mustn&#39;t let the child get into the habit . . .&#39;? Is the fact that the Narrator succeeds in getting the kiss he wants a good thing or a bad thing? Why? 4. &#39;The whole of Proust&#39;s world comes out of a teacup,&#39; observed Samuel Beckett. Indeed the episode of the madeleine dipped in tea is the first (and most famous) of numerous instances of &#39;involuntary memory&#39; in the novel. A recognized psychological phenomenon triggered by smells, tastes, or sounds, involuntary memory vividly reproduces emotions, sensations, or images from the past. Why do you think readers and critics universally consider this scene to be pivotal? What does the Narrator think about the experience of involuntary memory? What might its function be in the scheme of In Search of Lost Time ? 5. Another emblematic theme involves the recurring &#39;little phrase&#39; of music by Vinteuil that catches the ear of Swann at the Verdurin&#39;s salon and steals into his life. How do Vinteuil&#39;s compositions stir both Swann and the Narrator? In Proust&#39;s scheme of things, is music a higher art than painting or writing because it can produce involuntary memories? How does involuntary memory affect writing and painting? Is it unrelated to art except as a necessary catalyst? 6. In &#39;Combray&#39; we are introduced to the Narrator&#39;s family, their household, and their country home. Since Paris is the true heart of upper-class France, why do you think Proust chose to begin In Search of Lost Time elsewhere? What do we learn from the Narrator&#39;s description of his family&#39;s life and habits? Is the household dominated by men or by women? Does the Narrator&#39;s account seem accurate, or is it colored by his own ideas and preoccupations? 7. A madeleine dipped into a cup of tea first impelled Proust into the &#39;remembrance of things past.&#39; Though Proust was a gourmet in his youth, in the final years of his life he subsisted mainly on fillets of sole, chicken, fried potatoes, ice cream, cakes, fruit, and iced beer. Consider how food and culinary happenings - from meals at the restaurant in the Grand Hotel in Balbec to dinners at La Raspeli�re and the Guermantes&#39;s in Paris - form an integral part of the work. 8. Swann&#39;s Way and the Guermantes Way are presented as mutually exclusive choices for promenades, with Swann&#39;s Way given primacy of place at the novel&#39;s outset. Where, metaphorically speaking, does Swann&#39;s Way seem to lead? What are the aesthetic signposts and milestones the Narrator points out? What does the landscape around Combray represent? 9. &#39;I want my work to be a sort of cathedral in literature,&#39; Proust once said. In his description of the area around Combray - and in many other places in the novel - the Narrator describes churches, and particularly steeples. Indeed, Howard Moss cites the steeple as one of Proust&#39;s most important symbols. In religious architecture, the steeple represents man&#39;s aspiration toward God, and by inference toward Art, the Proustian religion. What else might it suggest? Does it have a counterpart in nature? 10. Proust and the Narrator share an appreciation of gardens and flowers - Proust himself was eager to visit Monet&#39;s celebrated garden - and in a sense, all Combray can be seen as a garden. What associations does this evoke? How does the Narrator respond to natural beauty? What do flowers mean to him? How do we know? 11. Proust&#39;s work is filled with &#39;doubling&#39; - the most obvious being the identification of the author with a fictional self of the same name but with somewhat different characteristics. Is Swann a double of the Narrator? What qualities do they share? In what ways do they seem different? What is the importance of the fact that Swann is a Jew? 12. Louis Auchincloss questions the use of a fictional first person named &#39;Marcel,&#39; who is but isn&#39;t Proust. Marcel claims that he is neither a snob nor a homosexual, yet he is obsessed with both. Would Proust have strengthened Marcel&#39;s viewpoint by making it that of the young social climber that he himself so clearly was? Did he enhance or detract from Marcel&#39;s credibility by casting him as one of the few heterosexuals in the book? Does it matter that Marcel regards &#39;inversion&#39; as a dangerous vice? Did Proust? 13. &#39;Swann in Love&#39; might be thought of as a dress rehearsal for the Narrator&#39;s own performance, and Swann&#39;s passion for Odette establishes a model for various other love relationships that appear later in the book. Proust believed that all emotions and behavior obey certain psychological laws. E. M. Forster maintained that &#39;Proust&#39;s general theory of human intercourse is that the fonder we are of people the less we understand them - the theory of the complete pessimist.&#39; Do you agree? How does Swann&#39;s love affair reflect this? What conclusions does the Narrator draw from his perception of Swann&#39;s experience? In what way does this differ from Swann&#39;s own view? 14. The Balbec sequence of Within a Budding Grove gathers a group of the novel&#39;s principal characters, many for the first time: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus, and Albertine, to name three of the most important. Others begin to emerge in their true significance, like Elstir the painter. Why do you think Proust chose to bring them together in Balbec? In what ways does Balbec echo or amplify Combray? Is the little &#39;society&#39; of Balbec a preview in microcosm of Paris? 15. While writing In Search of Lost Time Proust often rummaged through his vast photographic collection of Belle �poque luminaries as a means of stimulating his memory. &#39;You could see that his thoughts were following a kind of underground track, as if he were organizing everything into images before putting them into words,&#39; recalled his maid C�leste Albaret. Indeed, the Baron de Charlus, in Within a Budding Grove , speaks of the special importance of photographs in preserving an unsullied moment of time past, before it has been altered by the present. Discuss how Proust used photographs in the story - just as he exploited the technology of trains, cars, and airplanes - as symbols of passing time. 16. In his landmark essay on Proust, Edmund Wilson praises the broad Dickensian humor and extravagant satire that animate vast sections of In Search of Lost Time , yet he goes on to call it &#39;one of the gloomiest books ever written.&#39; Can you reconcile Wilson&#39;s remarks? 17. Critic Barbara Bucknall maintains that &#39;no Proustian lover really cares at all for his beloved&#39;s feelings.&#39; Is this true? Would the Narrator agree? Would the</p><p>&#x201c;As close to being a definitive English version of the great novel as we are likely to get.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of his generation. His work, whilst appearing to capture the immediacy of the moment and character of the subject, also examines the dynamics of photographic representation. From the outset he ignored the traditional separation of art exhibited in a gallery from images and ideas conveyed through other forms of publication, giving equal weight to both. His expansive floor to ceiling installations feature images of subcultures and political movements, as well as portraits, landscapes, still-lives and abstract imagery varying in scale from postcard- to wall-sized prints. His work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1996 and Tate Britain, London, in a major retrospective in 2003. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 2000.These two new works are united by the fact that each of the twentysomething artists earned a place in this fall's round-up of best new photographers at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In a book devoid of text (even the copyright information is on the back cover), Billingham presents an extended album of his family's life in the projects near Birmingham, England. The brutally frank snapshots center on Ray, Richard's alcholic father, Liz, his chainsmoking mother, and his brother Jason. Mostly disturbing yet sometimes beautiful, the haunting images seem to carry the burden of documentation, declaring their existence to be a necessary proof. Tillmans, a German photographer who has lived and worked in Hamburg, London, and New York intermingles without distinction his art images and his fashion and portrait work for magazines. This catalog for a one person show at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg collects a diverse selection of his images. Sequenced by Tillmans, the catalog places a special emphasis on the landscapes and still lifes that have often been overlooked by critics who have labeled Tillmans the documentarian of an urban Generation X.

Why do we behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce us, or even lead us astray? <br><br>According to W. J. T. Mitchell, we need to reckon with images not just as inert objects that convey meaning but as animated beings with desires, needs, appetites, demands, and drives of their own. <i>What Do Pictures Want?</i> explores this idea and highlights Mitchell's innovative and profoundly influential thinking on picture theory and the lives and loves of images. Ranging across the visual arts, literature, and mass media, Mitchell applies characteristically brilliant and wry analyses to Byzantine icons and cyberpunk films, racial stereotypes and public monuments, ancient idols and modern clones, offensive images and found objects, American photography and aboriginal painting. Opening new vistas in iconology and the emergent field of visual culture, he also considers the importance of Dolly the Sheep&#x2014;who, as a clone, fulfills the ancient dream of creating a living image&#x2014;and the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11, which, among other things, signifies a new and virulent form of iconoclasm.<br><br><i>What Do Pictures Want?</i> offers an immensely rich and suggestive account of the interplay between the visible and the readable. A work by one of our leading theorists of visual representation, it will be a touchstone for art historians, literary critics, anthropologists, and philosophers alike. <br><br>&nbsp; &#x201c;A treasury of episodes&#x2014;generally overlooked by art history and visual studies&#x2014;that turn on images that &#x2018;walk by themselves&#x2019; and exert their own power over the living.&#x201d;&#x2014;Norman Bryson, <i>Artforum <br><br></i></p><p><b>W.

His trenchant new book distills this lifetime of experience in the public and private sectors; it is a scathing critique of matters as they stand today.<br>Sounding the alarm about the increasing gap between reality and "conventional wisdom" -- a phrase he coined -- Galbraith tells, along with much else, how we have reached a point where the private sector has unprecedented control over the public sector. We have given ourselves over to self-serving belief and "contrived nonsense" or, more simply, fraud. This has come at the expense of the economy, effective government, and the business world.<br>Particularly noted is the central power of the corporation and the shift in authority from shareholders and board members to management. In an intense exercise of fraud, the pretense of shareholder power is still maintained, even with the immediate participants. In fact, because of the scale and complexity of the modern corporation, decisive power must go to management. From management and its own inevitable self-interest, power extends deeply into government -- the so-called public sector. This is particularly and dangerously the case in such matters as military policy, the environment, and, needless to say, taxation. Nevertheless, there remains the firm reference to the public sector.<br>How can fraud be innocent? In his inimitable style, Galbraith offers the answer. His taut, wry, and severe comment is essential reading for everyone who cares about America's future. This book is especially relevant in an election year, but it deeply concerns the much longer future.</p><p>John Kenneth Galbraith has been immersed in economics for most of his long and remarkable life. The purpose of this extended essay is to illuminate examples of "innocent fraud" or the gulf between perception and reality in the modern American economic system--a system he had a hand in creating during his tenure in FDR's administration. Though tackling serious subjects, the book sparkles with wit and sly understatement. "A marked enjoyment can be found in identifying self-serving belief and contrived nonsense," he writes, clearly enjoying himself. <p> The dominant role of the corporation in modern society is one such form of innocent fraud, and he explains how managers hold the real power in our system, not consumers or shareholders as the image would suggest. Despite the "appearance of relevance for owners," capitalism has given way to corporate bureaucracy--"a bureaucracy in control of its task and its compensation. Rewards that verge on larceny."</p><p> He also explains how the public realm is effectively controlled by the private sector. The arms industry is but one example of this: "While the Pentagon is still billed as being of the public sector, few doubt the influence of corporate power in its decisions." He also looks at the financial world which "sustains a large, active, well-rewarded community based on compelled but seemingly sophisticated ignorance," and in particular the Federal Reserve System, "our most prestigious form of fraud, our most elegant escape from reality." In essence, Galbraith says that the Fed, for all of its power and prestige, effectively does nothing. And he has little problem with this: "Let their ineffective role be accepted and forgiven."</p><p> Both a guide to the present and an aid to shaping the future, this slim, satisfying book is a font of wisdom, conventional and otherwise, from a respected elder statesman in the twilight of his life. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p>John Kenneth Galbraith who was born in 1908, is the Paul M.

His work bears special resonance for writers and readers, and yet his paintings never tell a story so much as they invite viewers to find for themselves the untold stories within."<br><br> So says Lawrence Block, who has invited seventeen outstanding writers to join him in an unprecedented anthology of brand-new stories: <em>In Sunlight or In Shadow</em>. The results are remarkable and range across all genres, wedding literary excellence to storytelling savvy.<br><br> Contributors include Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Robert Olen Butler, Michael Connelly, Megan Abbott, Craig Ferguson, Nicholas Christopher, Jill D. Block, Joe R. Lansdale, Justin Scott, Kris Nelscott, Warren Moore, Jonathan Santlofer, Jeffery Deaver, Lee Child, and Lawrence Block himself. Even Gail Levin, Hopper&#x2019;s biographer and compiler of his catalogue raison�e, appears with her own first work of fiction, providing a true account of art theft on a grand scale and told in the voice of the country preacher who perpetrated the crime.<br><br> In a beautifully produced anthology as befits such a collection of acclaimed authors, each story is illustrated with a quality full-color reproduction of the painting that inspired it.</p><p>Lawrence Block&nbsp;has been writing award-winning mystery and suspense fiction for half a century. His novels include&nbsp;The Girl With the Deep Blue Eyes,&nbsp;The Burglar Who Counted the Spoons, Hit Me, and A Drop of the Hard Stuff,&nbsp;featuring Matthew Scudder. He's well known for his books for writers, including the classic&nbsp;Telling Lies For Fun &amp; Profit and Write for Your Life,&nbsp;and he has recently published&nbsp;The Crime of Our Lives,&nbsp;a collection of his writings about the mystery genre and its practitioners.&#x201c;If a picture is worth a thousand words, any of Edward Hopper&#x2019;s paintings of American loneliness is worth an entire short story. Ekphrasis&#x2015;seeing a story in a picture&#x2015;was seldom so much fun.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Superbly conceived and executed. With stunning imagination, narrative power and arresting prose, each story succeeds individually and contributes to the overarching excellence of Block&#x2019;s anthology.

Short stories by 17 writers&#x2015;some famous, like Joyce Carol Oates and Stephen King, some less so&#x2015;dramatically start where the paintings leave off.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Block invited fellow mystery writers and other literary luminaries to pick a Hopper painting and write a story inspired by it. The 17 results are searing and ensnaring, clever, erotic, and disquieting tales of anger and subterfuge, desperation and revenge. A lushly illustrated, darkly alluring, deliciously unnerving union of art and story.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A great idea and a strong collection.

His semi-autobiographical first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, became an instant best-seller and established an image of seemingly carefree, party-mad young men and women out to create a new morality for a new, post-war America.

It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun.

Nick Montfort, an interactive fiction author himself, offers both aficionados and first-time users a way to approach interactive fiction that will lead to a more pleasurable and meaningful experience of it.</p><p><i>Twisty Little Passages</i> looks at interactive fiction beginning with its most important literary ancestor, the riddle. Montfort then discusses <i>Adventure</i> and its precursors (including the <i>I Ching</i> and <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>), and follows this with an examination of mainframe text games developed in response, focusing on the most influential work of that era, Zork. He then considers the introduction of commercial interactive fiction for home computers, particularly that produced by Infocom. Commercial works inspired an independent reaction, and Montfort describes the emergence of independent creators and the development of an online interactive fiction community in the 1990s. Finally, he considers the influence of interactive fiction on other literary and gaming forms.

Griffiths is just a Midwest kid, the son of a preacher in Kansas City, who tastes a little sophistication and then hits the road seeking pleasure and success. He has his moments, conducting more than one romantic affair, until that ill-advised pursuit ensnares him. Then he reads about an "accident" of a young woman and ponders a dastardly deed ... Dreiser spins these scenes with the eye of a master in control of his form. <i>An American Tragedy</i> stands as an American masterpiece.<b>Theodore Dreiser</b> was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on August 27, 1871. After a poor and difficult childhood, Dreiser broke into newspaper work in Chicago in 1892. A successful career as a magazine writer in New York during the late 1890s was followed by his first novel, <b>Sister Carrie</b> (1900). When this work made little impact, Dreiser published no fiction until <b>Jennie Gerhardt</b> in 1911. There then followed a decade and a half of major work in a number of literary forms, which was capped in 1925 by <b>An American Tragedy</b>, a novel that brought him universal acclaim.

Including favorites such as "The Wheels on the Bus" as well as folk songs from a variety of Spanish-speaking countries, <i>Diez Deditos</i> is a treat for the eyes, ears, and fingers. Lyrics are presented in both English and Spanish, and easy-to-follow musical accompaniment and diagrams for the corresponding actions are also provided. As in the companion volume <i>De Colores</i>, bright collage illustrations by Elisa Kleven complete the appeal of this fun-filled book.</p><p>Jose-Luis Orozco is a bilingual children's performer, recording artist, and author who makes appearances nationwide. He lives in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;<br><br> Elisa Kleven grew up making dollhouses and collages out of doilies and postage stamps.

The dynamic team that brought readers the popular <i>De Colores</i> (1994) is back with lively finger rhymes and more exuberant songs from Latin America. This new collection will be as treasured as the first book and just as well used. Adults working with children will find many instructional possibilities and curricular connections, and there are ample opportunities to get kids clapping, giggling, wiggling, tickling, and much more. The 34 selections are developmentally appropriate for younger children, but some can also be used with older students. Kleven's rich and vibrant collage illustrations are again wonderfully engaging. This time, she has added visual prompts to cue children to the appropriate body movements for accompanying the songs and rhymes. There are no source notes, but explanatory notes precede each selection, and there's a useful subject index. English translations have been made keeping rhythm and rhyme more in mind than the literal meaning in Spanish. <i>Karen Morgan</i></p><h2>After Man: A Zoology of the Future</h2><p><br>What exotic creatures does tomorrow hold?

What makes your book important right now?</strong></p> <p>A. PowerShell and Windows, in general, are rapidly evolving technologies. As time passes, they evolve to solve significantly new challenges, and simplify challenges that were difficult in previous versions. With the release of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, Windows PowerShell has added many significant features to address the realities of modern, multi-machine environments. PowerShell has also made many changes to simplify and improve its fundamentals (scripting and built-in commands.) The sooner you can learn about those improvements, the better your life will be.</p> <p><strong>Q. What information do you hope that readers of your books will walk away with?</strong></p> <p>A. PowerShell is an amazing platform, an amazing glue language, and an amazingly powerful way to just get things done. For those just stepping into scripting or management, it may seem daunting at first. By breaking the "PowerShell Cookbook" into a series of simple, isolated recipes, I hope that they see evidence that you don't need to be an expert in PowerShell to start using it or improving your day-to-day tasks.</p> <p><strong>Q. What's the most exciting/important thing happening in your space?</strong></p> <p>A. Windows Administrators have long lived on a diet of point-and-click. The move to systems automation (as opposed to simply systems management) is becoming a driving force in the industry, and an accelerating factor in the careers of all who adopt it. This is especially true now that administrators are being asked to manage orders of magnitude more servers-- from large enterprise deployments, to the massive expansion of virtualization, to the DevOps role and operations management in the cloud. PowerShell is perfectly suited for this environment, and has been crafted from the start to make you efficient in it.</p>Covers PowerShell 3.0</p><h2>Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History with Documents</h2><p><i>Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict</i> brings the multi-faceted story of the struggle in the Middle East to life for readers.

Wood<br><br> Benjamin Franklin is perhaps the most remarkable figure in American history: the greatest statesman of his age, he played a pivotal role in the formation of the American republic. He was also a pioneering scientist, a bestselling author, the country&#x2019;s first postmaster general, a printer, a bon vivant, a diplomat, a ladies&#x2019; man, and a moralist&#x2014;and the most prominent celebrity of the eighteenth century.<br><br> Franklin was, however, a man of vast contradictions, as Edmund Morgan demonstrates in this brilliant biography. A reluctant revolutionary, Franklin had desperately wished to preserve the British Empire, and he mourned the break even as he led the fight for American independence. Despite his passion for science, Franklin viewed his groundbreaking experiments as secondary to his civic duties. And although he helped to draft both the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution, he had personally hoped that the new American government would take a different shape. Unraveling the enigma of Franklin&#x2019;s character, Morgan shows that he was the rare individual who consistently placed the public interest before his own desires.<br><br> Written by one of our greatest historians, <i>Benjamin Franklin</i> offers a provocative portrait of America&#x2019;s most extraordinary patriot.</p><p>Chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the New York Times Book Review and as a best book for 2002 by the Los Angeles Times Book Review, Washington Post Book World, and Publishers Weekly, A finalist for the 2003 National Book Critics Circle Award for biography, A New York Times Bestseller&#34;Superb. . . .

The month before their second anniversary, during a long-awaited holiday, Aura broke her neck while body surfing. Francisco, blamed for Aura&#x2019;s death by her family and blaming himself, wanted to die, too. Instead, he wrote <i>Say Her Name</i>, a novel chronicling his great love and unspeakable loss, tracking the stages of grief when pure love gives way to bottomless pain.<br><br>Suddenly a widower, Goldman collects everything he can about his wife, hungry to keep Aura alive with every memory. From her childhood and university days in Mexico City with her fiercely devoted mother to her studies at Columbia University, through their newlywed years in New York City and travels to Mexico and Europe and always through the prism of her gifted writings Goldman seeks her essence and grieves her loss. Humor leavens the pain as he lives through the madness of grief and creates a living portrait of a love as joyous as it is deep and profound.<br><br><i>Say Her Name</i> is a love story, a bold inquiry into destiny and accountability, and a tribute to Aura, who she was and who she would've been.</p><p>FRANCISCO GOLDMAN is the author of three novels: The Long Night of White Chickens, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction and was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award; The Ordinary Seaman, a finalist for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and The Los Angeles Times Book Prize; and The Divine Husband.

While many think the answer to this question can be found in the Bible, others look to archaeology or genetics. Some skeptics have even sought to debunk the very idea that the Jews have a common origin. In this book, Steven Weitzman takes a learned and lively look at what we know&#x2015;or think we know&#x2015;about where the Jews came from, when they arose, and how they came to be.</p><p>Scholars have written hundreds of books on the topic and have come up with scores of explanations, theories, and historical reconstructions, but this is the first book to trace the history of the different approaches that have been applied to the question, including genealogy, linguistics, archaeology, psychology, sociology, and genetics. Weitzman shows how this quest has been fraught since its inception with religious and political agendas, how anti-Semitism cast its long shadow over generations of learning, and how recent claims about Jewish origins have been difficult to disentangle from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He does not offer neatly packaged conclusions but invites readers on an intellectual adventure, shedding new light on the assumptions and biases of those seeking answers&#x2015;and the challenges that have made finding answers so elusive.</p><p>Spanning more than two centuries and drawing on the latest findings, <i>The Origin of the Jews</i> brings needed clarity and historical context to this enduring and often divisive topic.</p></p><p><p>"Positioning himself between those who seek origins and those who regard such quests with postmodern skepticism, Weitzman sheds light on variegated accounts of Jewish origins in different realms--from genealogical research and biblical scholarship to archaeology, psychoanalysis, and genetic research. A brilliant book--profoundly original and engaging, exhibiting a rare spirit of exploration. We will all be learning from it for a long time."<b>--Ilana Pardes, author of <i>Agnon's Moonstruck Lovers</i></b></p><p>"Weitzman is a spirited and empathetic guide on an expedition through the quest to understand Jewish origins, from biblical studies to the latest investigations in population genetics. He unfailingly confronts the challenges of his inquiry with candor and erudition. The book gathers a remarkable exchange among diverse lines of scholarship in a single captivating conversation."<b>--Noah Rosenberg, professor of biology, Stanford University</b></p><p>"The long duration of the history of the Jews is paralleled by an almost equally long tradition of searching after their roots. This quest is masterfully narrated and keenly analyzed by Weitzman, who enlists a rich array of disciplines ranging from biblical philology and archeology to psychoanalysis and genetic science. His elegantly accessible prose and imaginative scholarly thinking combine to make this immensely informative book a pleasure to read."<b>--Galit Hasan-Rokem, professor emerita, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</b></p><p>"Compellingly argued and very original.

Wilson published <em>Sociobiology</em>, it generated a firestorm of criticism, mostly focused on the book's final chapter, in which Wilson applied lessons learned from animal behavior to human society. In <em>Defenders of the Truth</em>, Ullica Segerstrale takes a hard look at the sociobiology controversy, sorting through a hornet's nest of claims and counterclaims, moral concerns, metaphysical beliefs, political convictions, strawmen, red herrings, and much juicy gossip. The result is a fascinating look at the world of modern science. <br> Segerstrale has interviewed all the major participants, including such eminent scientists as Stephen Jay Gould, Richard C. Lewontin, Richard Dawkins, John Maynard Smith, Nobel Laureates Peter Medawar and Salvador Luria, and of course Edward Wilson. She reveals that most of the criticism of Wilson was unfair, but argues that it was not politically motivated. Instead, she sees the conflict over sociobiology as a drawn-out battle about the nature of "good science" and the social responsibility of the scientist. Behind the often nasty attacks were the very different approaches to science taken by naturalists (such as Wilson) and experimentalists (such as Lewontin), between the "planters" and the "weeders." The protagonists were all defenders of the truth, Segerstrale concludes, it was just that everyone's truth was different.<br> <em>Defenders of the Truth</em> touches on grand themes such as the unity of knowledge, human nature, and free will and determinism, and it shows how the sociobiology controversy can shed light on the more recent debates over the Human Genome Project and <em>The Bell Curve</em>. It will appeal to all readers of Edward O. Wilson or Stephen Jay Gould and all those who enjoy a behind-the-scenes peek at modern science.</p><p>How do scientists separate their politics from their work--or is such a distinction even possible? These questions frame the two levels of sociologist Ullica Segerstrale's analysis of the sociobiology controversy, <i>Defenders of the Truth</i>. From E.O. Wilson's 1975 publication of <i>Sociobiology</i> to his 1998 release of <i>Consilience</i>, he has consistently been the often-unwilling center of the vitriolic debate over human nature and its scientific study. Heavy hitters like Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and John Maynard Smith have lined up to attack and defend the scientific, political, and moral interpretations and implications of Wilson's synthesis, and Dr. Segerstrale tells a compelling story of their battles on multiple fronts. The author knows her science, having trained extensively in biochemistry before turning to sociology. While she distances herself from assessing the validity of the various claims, Segerstrale is clearly sympathetic to Wilson, who seems almost na�ve at times when his ideas are interpreted ideologically rather than scientifically.<p> That, of course, is the heart of the contention surrounding sociobiology. The political left, well-represented among evolutionary biologists, has long considered any genetic influence on human behavior anathema--such theories are believed to support racist policies, even in the unlikely event that they were not merely reflections of racist attitudes. To their credit, many scientists held more complex beliefs, but some used the ideological argument as a back door to introduce their own neo-Darwinian scientific theories. The struggle for understanding has been eclipsed for some time by the struggle for political and academic survival and dominance, and Segerstrale reports and scrutinizes both with humor, intelligence, and aplomb. The end of the controversy--if there can be one--is far off, but a careful reading of <i>Defenders of the Truth</i> will give insight into the forces influencing our scientific self-examination. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><strong>Ullica Segerstrale</strong> is Professor of Sociology at Illinois Institute of Technology, in Chicago.

Because they were given to &#34;pioneers&#34; dedicated to opening a new Waldorf school, these talks are often considered one of the best introductions to Waldorf education. Steiner shows the necessity for teachers to work on themselves first, in order to transform their own inherent gifts. He explains the need to use humor to keep their teaching lively and imaginative. Above all, he stresses the tremendous importance of doing everything in the knowledge that children are citizens of both the spiritual and the earthly worlds. And, throughout these lectures, he continually returns to the practical value of Waldorf education. These talks are filled with practical illustrations and revolve around certain themes-the need for observation in teachers; the dangers of stressing the intellect too early; children&#39;s need for teaching that is concrete and pictorial; the education of children&#39;s souls through wonder and reverence; the importance of first presenting the &#34;whole,&#34; then the parts, to the children&#39;s imagination. Here is one of the best introductions to Waldorf education, straight from the man who started it all.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b> (1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up. As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Concepts of Modern Physics</h2><p>This book is intended to be used with a one-semester course in modern physics for students who have already had basic physics and calculus courses.

How should directors shoot scenes in confined spaces, such as small rooms or the interior of a car, in large open spaces, or with a number of characters involved in busy dialogue? As in his previous book, Katz addresses these problems by storyboarding hypothetical scenes for the camera, laying out a drawing of each shot in the sequence for readers to study. As a bonus, the book is peppered with interviews about creating shot sequences that Katz conducted with a number of professional filmmakers, including Allen Daviau, Ralph Singleton, and John Sayles.</p><h2>The Irish Brigade and Its Campaigns (The Irish in the Civil War)</h2><p>Few brigades of the Civil War can boast of a record as distinguished as that of New York&#39;s 69th, yet it has never fully received the attention warranted by its record of military excellence, distinctive reputation, and the unusual perspective its members brought to the Civil War. In fact, the 69th was engaged in nearly every major action of the eastern theater; its military reputation was well deserved and its combat casualties, which are some of the highest of the war, are testimony to the soldiers&#39; collective bravery and patriotism. In his post as war correspondent for the New York Herald, Capt. David Power Conygham was required to be an eyewitness to the many battles on which he reported - some of the experiences he would later describe when writing the history of the Irish Brigade. Conygham&#39;s account of the Irish Brigade is one of the best - filled with vivid accounts of battle, wit and humor, and an appendix of scrupulously gathered biographical data on the men who served the unit.</p><p>No Civil War unit had a more colorful or distinctive history than the Irish Brigade of the Army of the Potomac. Made up of thousands of Irish immigrants from New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, it charged into battle under green flags and was served by Catholic chaplains. The brigade was created and led by Thomas Francis Meagher, an Irish revolutionary who had been condemned by the British for his part in the Rising of 1848. Making his way to New York after escaping from a prison colony, he established himself as one of the chief spokesman of the Irish-American community.

The author considers such wide-ranging themes as attitudes toward wealth and display, the articulation of family identity, and the visual culture of Venetian women&#x2015;how they decorated their homes, dressed, undertook domestic tasks, entertained, and raised their children.

Collector and gallery owner Solomon and critic Anderson profile 22 significant private collections said to exemplify "independent and often stubborn vision," yet perfunctory writing and elementary ideas (in hanging pictures, "the best guideline is an understanding of the artist's or art work's aesthetic intention") make these 22 collections seem like only three or four. A few collections are indeed beautifully integrated with their surroundings. More often, though, art objects look crowded and ill-at-ease in apartments that are showrooms, not living quarters. Also disturbing is the coauthors' assumptionborne out in the opulent interiors they celebratethat wealth is the sine qua non of art appreciation. An index provides brief information on how to obtain, conserve and insure works of art. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This irresistible book could be titled This Is Your Life: A Personal Guide to Collecting and Living with Art. More than a how-to book, it presents individual art collecting to the novice in a thoughtful and personal way. Both practical approaches to collecting and displaying art and the responsibilities of owning a collection are covered. Offering in its abundant illustrations glimpses of the private collections of many of today's most notable collectors, the book places art in the context of one's environment or domestic setting. We thus come to understand that a collection is most successful when it reflects a personal philosophy or taste rather than just an investment. With a brief history of decorative arts in the home.

These were friends he knew, loved, and missed. His purpose in writing was to thank them for their work of faith, their labor of love, and their continued hope in the Lord Jesus Christ . . . and His coming again. Paul was also eager to remind them of the example their faithfulness had been to those around them.</p><p>Similarly, Paul&#x2019;s letter to Titus&#x2014;a young pastor in Crete&#x2014;is filled with personal affirmation, counsel, and guidance on how to prepare church leaders for effective evangelism. Paul wrote this letter so Titus could &#x201c;set in order the things that are lacking&#x201d; and &#x201c;speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine&#x201d; (Titus 1:5; 2:1). These letters of instruction are as inspirational for us today as they were for these first-century Christ followers.</p><p>The MacArthur Bible Studies provide intriguing examinations of the whole of Scripture.

Whitton, M.D., PH.D., co-author with Joe Fischer of <i>Life Between Life</i></p><p> "Adam Crabtree offers a masterful exploration of the varieties of trance experience. Written with clarity and compassion, this book offers the state of the art in understanding one of the least understood of all human phenomena.

What makes it so stimulating is that he takes a basic and simple idea--that we all spend more time in 'trance' than we realize--and then develops it in wholly unexpected ways...Crabtree suggests that our culture induces a trance state--in fact, many kinds of 'microtrances'--and that we have to awaken from this trance before we can enter the condition he calls Trance Zero, a state of being in touch with our 'inner guidance.'...It seems to me that Adam is a new kind of psychologist--one who intuitively understands that the mind is far vaster and stranger than anyone suspected--and at the same time, stronger and more full of creative possibilities." --Colin Wilson, author of <i>The Outsider</i> and <i>Alien Dawn: An Investigation into the Contact Experience</i></p>Adam Crabtree is a practicing psychotherapist and author of a number of books dealing with hypnosis and unusual psychological conditions.

According to Michael Barkun in this fascinating yet disturbing book, quite a lot. It is well known that some Americans are obsessed with conspiracies. The Kennedy assassination, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the 2001 terrorist attacks have all generated elaborate stories of hidden plots. What is far less known is the extent to which conspiracist worldviews have recently become linked in strange and unpredictable ways with other "fringe" notions such as a belief in UFOs, Nostradamus, and the Illuminati. Unraveling the extraordinary genealogies and permutations of these increasingly widespread ideas, Barkun shows how this web of urban legends has spread among subcultures on the Internet and through mass media, how a new style of conspiracy thinking has recently arisen, and how this phenomenon relates to larger changes in American culture. This book, written by a leading expert on the subject, is the most comprehensive and authoritative examination of contemporary American conspiracism to date.<br><br>Barkun discusses a range of material&#x2014;involving inner-earth caves, government black helicopters, alien abductions, secret New World Order cabals, and much more&#x2014;that few realize exists in our culture. Looking closely at the manifestions of these ideas in a wide range of literature and source material from religious and political literature, to New Age and UFO publications, to popular culture phenomena such as <i>The X-Files, </i>and to websites, radio programs, and more, Barkun finds that America is in the throes of an unrivaled period of millennarian activity. His book underscores the importance of understanding why this phenomenon is now spreading into more mainstream segments of American culture.</p><p>"Tracing the beliefs in various conspiracies and mega-conspiracies in literature, apocalyptic and political writing, and popular culture, Barkun creates an exceptional and invaluable genealogy of the extraordinary permutations that these ideas have undergone since WWII and, of course, as a result of the Internet. Barkun dives into the religious and political matrix of what some call the "lunatic fringe," forcing us to look at the revival and spread of conspiracist thinking on an even grander scale into broad reaches of American culture. For those who think conspiracy thinking is a fading phenomenon, or a cultural phenomenon of little significance or creativity, think again. Welcome to the third millennium."

Chip Berlet, co-author of <i>Right-Wing Populism in America</i><br><br>"This is a gripping, and at times scary, book. Michael Barkun, one of our most respected political scientists, has produced a meticulously researched and highly perceptive account of those who find credible an incredible assortment of nefarious conspiracies emanating not only from the Jews, Masons, Catholics and politicians in our midst, but also from ' out there.&#x2019; This book should be read by everyone who believes that there are some ways of checking the differences between truths and fantasies - and by everyone who doesn' t."

Langin-Hooper investigates the impact of Greek art on the miniature figure sculptures produced in Babylonia after the conquests of Alexander the Great. Figurines in Hellenistic Babylonia were used as agents of social change, by visually expressing and negotiating cultural differences. The scaled-down quality of figurines encouraged both visual and tactile engagement, enabling them to effectively work as non-threatening instruments of cultural blending.&nbsp;Reconstructing the embodied experience of miniaturization in detailed case studies, Langin-Hooper illuminates the dynamic process of combining Greek and Babylonian sculpture forms, social customs, and viewing habits into new, hybrid works of art. Her innovative focus on figurines as instruments of&nbsp;both&nbsp;personal encounter and global cultural shifts has important implications for the study of tiny objects in art history, anthropology, classics, and other disciplines.</p><p>This volume investigates the impact of Greek art, particularly Hellenistic sculpture motifs and styles on the figurines of Babylonia after the conquests of Alexander the Great.

In the second edition of <i>Network Security</i>, this most distinguished of author teams draws on hard-won experience to explain every facet of information security, from the basics to advanced cryptography and authentication; secure Web and email services; and emerging security standards. Highlights of the book's extensive new coverage include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), IPsec, SSL, PKI Standards, and Web security.</p><p>A comprehensive yet comprehensible and witty guide to the latest advances in computer network security protocols. In this book the authors go beyond documenting standards and technology; they contrast competing schemes, explain weaknesses and strengths, and describe common mistakes people make when intending to design secure systems.It was a dark and stormy night. Somewhere in the distance a dog howled. A shiny object caught Alice's eye. A diamond cufflink! Only one person in the household could afford diamond cufflinks! So it was the butler, after all! Alice had to warn Bob. But how could she get a message to him without alerting the butler? If she phoned Bob, the butler might listen on an extension. If she sent a carrier pigeon out the window with the message taped to its feet, how would Bob know it was Alice that was sending the message and not Trudy attempting to frame the butler because he spurned her advances? That's what this book is about. Not much character development for Alice and Bob, we're afraid, nor do we really get to know the butler. But we do discuss how to communicate securely over an insecure medium. <br> <br> What do we mean by communicating securely? Alice should be able to send a message to Bob that only Bob can understand, even though Alice can't avoid having others see what she sends. When Bob receives a message, he should be able to know for certain that it was Alice who sent the message, and that nobody tampered with the contents of the message in the time between when Alice launched the message and Bob received it. <br> <br> What do we mean by an insecure medium? Well, in some dictionary or another, under the definition of "insecure medium" should be a picture of the Internet. The world is evolving towards interconnecting every computer, and people talk about connecting household appliances as well, all into some wonderful global internetwork. How wonderful! You'd be able to send electronic mail to anyone in the world. <br> <br> You'd also be able to control your nuclear power plant with simple commands sent across the network while you were vacationing in Fiji. Or sunny Libya. Or historic Iraq. Inside the network the world is scary. There are links that eavesdroppers can listen in on. Information needs to be forwarded through packet switches, and these switches can be reprogrammed to listen to or modify data in transit. The situation might seem hopeless, but we may yet be saved by the magic of mathematics, and in particular cryptography, which can take a message and transform it into a bunch of numbers known as ciphertext. The ciphertext is unintelligible gibberish except to someone who knows the secret to reversing the transformation. Cryptography allows us to disguise our data so that eavesdroppers gain no information from listening to the information as transmitted. <br> <br> Cryptography also allows us to create an unforgeable message and protect it from being modified in transit. One method of accomplishing this is with a digital signature, a number associated with a message and its sender that can be verified as authentic by others, but can only be generated by the sender. This should seem astonishing. How can there be a number which you can verify but not generate? A person's handwritten signature can (more or less) only be generated by that person, though it can be verified by others. But it would seem as if a number shouldn't be hard to generate, especially if it can be verified. Theoretically you could generate someone's signature by trying lots of numbers and testing each one until one passed the verification test. But with the size of the numbers used, it would take too much compute time (for instance, several universe lifetimes) to generate the signature that way. So a digital signature has the same property as a handwritten signature, in that it can only be generated by one person. But a digital signature does more than a handwritten signature. <br> <br> Since the digital signature depends on the contents of the message, if someone alters the message the signature will no longer be correct and the tampering will be detected. This will all become clear if you read Chapter 2 Introduction to Cryptography. <br> <br> Cryptography is a major theme in this book, not because cryptography is intrinsically interesting (which it is), but because the security features people want in a computer network can best be provided through cryptography. <br> <br> 1.1. Roadmap to the Book The book is divided into three main sections. <br> <br> Cryptography. <br> <br> Chapter 2 Introduction to Cryptography is the only part of the cryptography section of the book essential for understanding the rest of the book, since it explains the generic properties of secret key, message digest, and public key algorithms, and how each is used. We've tried our best to make the descriptions of the actual cryptographic algorithms nonthreatening yet thorough, and to give intuition into why they work. It's intended to be readable by anyone, not just graduate students in mathematics. Never once do we use the term lemma. We do hope you read. <br> <br> Chapter 3 Secret Key Cryptography, Chapter 4 Hashes and Message Digests, and Chapter 5 Public Key Algorithms which give the details of the popular standards, but it's also OK to skip them and save them for later, or just for reference. For you math types who would have noticed that we skipped a number if we didn't mention it, Chapter 6 Number Theory gives a deeper treatment of the mathematics behind the cryptography. <br> <br> Authentication. <br> <br> Chapter 7 Authentication Systems introduces the general issues involved in proving your identity across a network. <br> <br> Chapter 8 Authentication of People deals with the special circumstances when the device proving its identity is a human being. <br> <br> Chapter 9 Security Handshake Pitfalls deals with the details of authentication handshakes. There are many security flaws that keep getting designed into protocols. This chapter attempts to describe variations of authentication handshakes and their relative security and performance strengths. We end the chapter with a checklist of security attacks, so that someone designing a protocol can specifically check their protocol for these flaws. <br> <br> Chapter 10 Kerberos V4 and Chapter 11 Kerberos V5 describe the details of those authentication systems. Secure electronic mail. Chapter 12 Electronic Mail Security describes the various types of security features one might want, and how they might be provided. Chapter 13 Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Chapter 14 PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), and Chapter 15 X.400 describe three mail standards which are compared in Chapter 16 A Comparison of PEM, PGP, and X.400. There are two chapters that aren't in any of the three main sections. The first chapter (the one you're reading now) gives a whirlwind tour of computer networking and computer security to set the stage for the main focus of the book-computer network security. The final chapter, Chapter 17 More Security Systems, describes a variety of security systems, including Novell NetWare (Versions 3 and 4), Lotus Notes, DCE, KryptoKnight/NetSP, Clipper, SNMP, DASS/SPX, and sabotage-proof routing protocols. <br> <br> 1.2. What type of book is this? <br> <br> We believe the reason most computer science is hard to understand is because of jargon and irrelevant details. When people work with something long enough they invent their own language, come up with some meta-architectural framework or other, and forget that the rest of the world doesn't talk or think that way. We intend this book to be reader-friendly. We try to extract the concepts and ignore the meta-architectural framework, since whatever a meta-architectural framework is, it's irrelevant to what something does and how it works. <br> <br> We believe someone who is a relative novice to the field ought to be able to read this book. But readability doesn't mean "lack of technical depth". We try to go beyond the information one might find in specifications. The goal is not just to describe exactly how the various standards and de facto standards work, but to explain why they are the way they are, why some protocols designed for similar purposes are different, and the implications of the design decisions. Sometimes engineering tradeoffs were made. <br> <br> Sometimes the designers could have made better choices (they are human after all), in which case we explain how the protocol could have been better. This analysis should make it easier to understand the current protocols, and aid in design of future protocols. <br> <br> The primary audience for this book is engineers, especially those who might need to evaluate the security of or add security features to a distributed system, but the book is also intended to be useable as a textbook, either on the advanced undergraduate or graduate level. Most of the chapters have homework problems at the end. <br> <br> 1.3. Terminology <br> <br> Any field with science in its name isn't. <br> <br> Tony Lauck <br> <br> Computer science is filled with ill-defined terminology used by different authors in conflicting ways, often by the same author in conflicting ways. We apologize in advance for probably being guilty sometimes ourselves. Some people take terminology very seriously, and once they start to use a certain word in a certain way, are extremely offended if the rest of the world does not follow. <br> <br> When I use a word, it means j</p><h2>101 Things I Learned in Culinary School</h2><p>Louis Eguaras, Vice Chair of the Culinary Arts Department at Los Angeles Mission College, provides readers with a terrific overview of food preparation, cooking, and presentation, along with insights into how to survive and thrive in the culinary profession. 101 illustrated lessons inform the reader on everything from the history of food to how to properly hold a knife, from kitchen organization to food preparation, and from plate presentation to restaurant management.<br><br>This installment in the popular 101 THINGS I LEARNED� book series will enlighten and entertain readers who are considering or are already enrolled in culinary school, as well as established culinary professionals and casual "foodies."</p><p>Louis Eguaras is Vice Chair of the Culinary Arts Department at Los Angeles Mission College, where he teaches courses in international cuisine and food history.

Jung</h2><p><p><strong>A lavishly illustrated volume of C.G. Jung&#x2019;s visual work, from drawing to painting to sculpture.</strong></p><p>A world-renowned, founding figure in analytical psychology, and one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most vibrant thinkers, C.G. Jung imbued as much inspiration, passion, and precision in what he made as in what he wrote. Though it spanned his entire lifetime and included painting, drawing, and sculpture, Jung&#x2019;s practice of visual art was a talent that Jung himself consistently downplayed out of a stated desire never to claim the title &#x201c;artist.&#x201d; But the long-awaited and landmark publication, in 2009, of C.G. Jung&#x2019;s <em>The Red Book</em> revealed an astonishing visual facet of a man so influential in the realm of thought and words, as it integrated stunning symbolic images with an exploration of &#x201c;thinking in images&#x201d; in therapeutic work and the development of the method of Active Imagination. The remarkable depictions that burst forth from the pages of that calligraphic volume remained largely unrecognized and unexplored until publication.</p><p>The release of <em>The Red Book</em> generated enormous interest in Jung&#x2019;s visual works and allowed scholars to engage with the legacy of Jung&#x2019;s creativity. The essays collected here present previously unpublished artistic work and address a remarkably broad spectrum of artistic accomplishment, both independently and within the context of <em>The Red Book</em>, itself widely represented. Tracing the evolution of Jung&#x2019;s visual efforts from early childhood to adult life while illuminating the close relation of Jung&#x2019;s lived experience to his scientific and creative endeavors, <em>The Art of C.G. Jung</em> offers a diverse exhibition of Jung&#x2019;s engagement with visual art as maker, collector, and analyst.</p> 254 illustrations</p><p><strong>The Foundation of the Works of C.G. Jung</strong>, based in Zurich, was established by the community of heirs of C.G. Jung in 2007. The present foundation is dedicated to the maintenance and development of the literary and creative heritage of Carl Gustav Jung and his wife, Emma Jung-Rauschenbach.</p><h2>Introduction to Forensic Psychology: Research and Application</h2><p>Filled with real&#x2013;life examples, practical applications, and case law discussions, <strong>Forensic Psychology: Research and Application, Fourth Edition</strong> covers new and emerging fields of study, the many areas where psychology plays a significant role in the civil and criminal justice systems, and the wide range of issues that are an integral part of the forensic psychologist&#x2019;s day-to-day work. This unique, career-oriented textbook emphasizes a multicultural perspective that focuses on the application of psychological knowledge and research. Authors Curt and Anne Bartol expose readers to emerging specializations within forensic psychology, including investigative psychology, family forensic psychology, and police and public safety psychology. The authors also provide extensive, up-to-date references for students to find more material on the subject areas covered.</p><p><b>Curt R.

After retiring from the military, he&nbsp;turned his paranormal detective skills to finding missing persons such as millionaire pilot Steve Fossett, whose plane vanished in Nevada, and a young Colorado girl named Christina White, who disappeared seemingly without a trace. He has even located one of the most legendary missing objects in history, the Ark of the Covenant.&nbsp; In <i>Tell Me What You See</i>, cosmic Columbo Major Ed Dames takes you behind the scenes of some of his most mind-bending cases.<br><ul><li>Reveals true stories and fascinating secrets uncovered by the military's remote viewing teams--from intelligence on Soviet missile sites to the whereabouts of missing POWs in Vietnam to the location of the Ark of the Covenant</li><li>Maj. Dames is the most popular guest on George Noory's exceedingly popular radio show <i>Coast to Coast AM</i></li></ul>For anyone fascinated by the intersection of the military and the mysterious, <i>Tell Me What You See</i> is an amazing and completely absorbing must-read. <br><br> <strong>Q&amp;A with Author Ed Dames</strong><br><br> <b>What got you interested in Remote Viewing? </b><br> Actually, I stumbled onto it by accident. As we detail in the book, once I had risen through the ranks of military intelligence, I was privy to the deepest darkest top-secret programs our government had to offer. When I learned there was this tested and proven capability out there to gather information about targets without actually sending operatives into the field, I jumped at it, I needed additional intelligence to crack critical problems at the time, and this breakthrough psychic technique was just what the doctor ordered. On a more personal level, I was always interested in the paranormal -- even as a boy, and remote viewing was the key to help unlock mysteries I&#x2019;ve been curious about for a very long time. RV presented a world without secrets on so many levels, and in the spy biz especially -- that&#x2019;s a really good world. <br><br> <b>What was your greatest RV success? </b><br> There have been so many it&#x2019;s hard to put my finger on just one. From finding missing and exploited children, to uncovering lost treasure like the Ark of the Covenant, to locating POWs and breaking the Soviet biological weapons program, the success rate in my career has been incredible. I suppose just keeping the military Psi Spy program alive as long as we did with so many enemies trying to shut us down could be considered a success. But I think taking the culmination of more than 25 years of developing this tool from the rigid confines of the military into the public arena has been most satisfying to me. To teach RV the way I do to eager and curious audiences around the world has been and continues to be an incredible experience. It makes it all worthwhile. <br><br> <b>Why is RV important? </b><br> In <i>Tell Me What You See</i> we demonstrate in no uncertain terms the powerful abilities the mind has locked away inside -- abilities most of us have only dreamed of. The human mind is unlike anything else there is, and we have only half- realized our potential. Now through the correct use of remote viewing, we can realize the other half. We show how anyone can learn RV to know anything, to gather direct knowledge of any event, person, or object across time and space. <br><br> <b>What are you currently working on? </b><br> I have recently completed work on an RV technique I call Geofix, where we can pinpoint the location of anything geographically with no margin of error whatsoever. This is a very exciting development and we are using Geofix to continue the work we&#x2019;ve always done such as hunting down child killers, locating treasure and searching for extraterrestrial and extradimensional life across the universe. As always we also continue to make use of RV to see what&#x2019;s coming in the future, to look for indicators of warning that affect all of us. In <i>Tell Me What You See</i> we attempt not so much to send a wake up call to people, as much as we want people to simply wake up. Here&#x2019;s a world too many know nothing about. We hope to change that. <br></p><p>"An extraordinary autobiography masquerading as a terrificespionage thriller."<br><b>&#x2014;Betsy Sharkey, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><p>As the operations and training officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency's Psychic Intelligence Unit, Major Ed Dames, with his team, used the practice of remote viewing to uncover accurate military intelligence&#x2014;from locating Soviet missile sites and Russian remote viewers to finding missing POWs in Vietnam and kidnapped U.S. general James Dozier.

This work takes an entirely new perspective. Aimed at the general reader with an interest in World War II and the U.S. Navy, the book looks at the massive salvage effort that followed the attack, beginning with the damage control efforts aboard the sinking and damaged ships in the harbor on 7 December 1941 and ending in March 1944 when salvage efforts on the USS Utah were finally abandoned. <p>The author tells the story in a narrative style, moving from activity to activity as the days and months wore on, in what proved to be an incredibly difficult and complex endeavor. But rather than writing a dry operational report, Dan Madsen describes the Navy's dramatic race to clear the harbor and repair as many ships as possible so they could return to the fleet ready for war. Numerous photographs, many never before published in books for the general public, give readers a real appreciation for the momentous task involved, from the raising of the USS Oglala in 1942 and the USS Oklahoma in 1943 to the eventual dismantling of the above-water portions of the USS Arizona. Madsen explains how a salvage organization was first set up, how priorities were scheduled, what specific plans were made and how they worked or, in many cases, did not work. His book is based almost entirely on primary sources, including the records of the fleet salvage unit and the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. 264 PAGES. 90 photographs. 11 line drawings. Appendixes.

What distinguishes <em>Othello</em> is its bold treatment of racial and gender themes. It is also the only tragedy to feature a main character, Iago, who truly seems evil, betraying and deceiving those that trust him purely for spite and with no political goal. This edition, the first to give full attention to these themes, includes an extensive introduction stresses the public dimensions of the tragedy, paying particular attention to its treatment of color and social relations. Designed to meet the needs of theatre professionals, the edition includes an extensive performance history, while on-page commentary and notes explain language, word play, and staging. Collated and edited from all existing printings, this entirely new edition uses modern day spelling to make readings smoother. Appendices are included which explain the dating problems many have found in the play, describe the music that has traditionally accompanied it, and provide a full translation of the Italian novella from which the story derives.<br> Like all editions of the Oxford Shakespeare in the Oxford World Classics series, <em>Othello</em> includes a full index to the introduction and commentary. It is illustrated with production photographs and related art, and features a durable sewn binding for lasting use. The Oxford Shakespeare offers authoritative texts from leading scholars in editions designed to interpret and illuminate the plays for all modern readers.</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s. The series, long since out-of-print, is now reissued. Each work contains a lengthy and lively introduction, main text, and substantial notes and glossary.Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>American Nietzsche: A History of an Icon and His Ideas</h2><p><p>If you were looking for a philosopher likely to appeal to Americans, Friedrich Nietzsche would be far from your first choice. After all, in his blazing career, Nietzsche took aim at nearly all the foundations of modern American life: Christian morality, the Enlightenment faith in reason, and the idea of human equality. Despite that, for more than a century Nietzsche has been a hugely popular&#x2014;and surprisingly influential&#x2014;figure in American thought and culture.<br> <br> In <i>American Nietzsche</i>, Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen delves deeply into Nietzsche's philosophy, and America&#x2019;s reception of it, to tell the story of his curious appeal. Beginning her account with Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom the seventeen-year-old Nietzsche read fervently, she shows how Nietzsche&#x2019;s ideas first burst on American shores at the turn of the twentieth century, and how they continued alternately to invigorate and to shock Americans for the century to come. She also delineates the broader intellectual and cultural contexts within which a wide array of commentators&#x2014;academic and armchair philosophers, theologians and atheists, romantic poets and hard-nosed empiricists, and political ideologues and apostates from the Left and the Right&#x2014;drew insight and inspiration from Nietzsche&#x2019;s claims for the death of God, his challenge to universal truth, and his insistence on the interpretive nature of all human thought and beliefs. At the same time, she explores how his image as an iconoclastic immoralist was put to work in American popular culture, making Nietzsche an unlikely posthumous celebrity capable of inspiring both teenagers and scholars alike.<br> <br> A penetrating examination of a powerful but little-explored undercurrent of twentieth-century American thought and culture, <i>American Nietzsche</i> dramatically recasts our understanding of American intellectual life&#x2014;and puts Nietzsche squarely at its heart.</p></p><p><b>Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen</b> is the&nbsp;Merle Curti Assistant Professor of&nbsp;History at the&nbsp;University of Wisconsin, Madison."A truly outstanding piece of intellectual history." <br> (<i>Review of Metaphysics</i>)</p><h2>The House on the Strand</h2><p><p>When Dick Young's friend, Professor Magnus Lane, offers him an escape from his troubles in the form of a new drug, Dick finds himself transported to fourteenth-century Cornwall. There, in the manor of Tywardreath, the domain of Sir Henry Champerhoune, he witnesses intrigue, adultery and murder.</p><p>The more time Dick spends consumed in the past, the more he withdraws from the modern world. With each dose of the drug, his body and mind become addicted to this otherworld, and his attempts to change history bring terror to the present and put his own life in jeopardy.</p></p><p><p>Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel,<i>The Loving Spirit</i>, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel<i>Rebecca</i>that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.<br>Many of du Maurier's bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock's<i>The Birds</i>and Nicolas Roeg's<i>Don't Look Now</i>. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE. She lived most of her life in Cornwall, the setting for many of her books.</p>Michael Maloney's tense reading, punctuated by musical interludes, at first gives this production the feel of a soap opera. But his intensity energizes this bleak, chilly novel of a man unhappy in his own life and obsessed with the past, which he can visit, or view, through an experimental time-travel drug. In a novel filled with unsympathetic characters, Maloney makes protagonist Dick seem more sympathetic than he would otherwise be. He indicates various characters skillfully through small shifts of voice; his American accent for Dick's wife is flawless. No one could make this novel fun; Maloney makes it involving. A printed insert on the story's background is helpful but contains many spoilers.

It is widely regarded as a classic text in the field. <br><br>Drawing on the biblical figure of Hagar mother of Ishmael, cast into the desert by Abraham and Sarah, but protected by God Williams finds a proptype for the struggle of African-American women. African slave, homeless exile, surrogate mother, Hagar s story provides an image of survival and defiance appropriate to black women today. Exploring the themes implicit in Hagar s story poverty and slavery, ethnicity and sexual exploitation, exile and encounter with God Williams traces parallels in the history of African-American women from slavery to the present day. A new womanist theology emerges from this shared experience, from the interplay of oppressions on account of race, sex and class.

Capra, a bestselling author, physicist, and systems theorist, and Mattei, a distinguished legal scholar, explain how, by incorporating concepts from modern science, the law can become an integral part of bringing about a better world, rather than facilitating its destruction. <br><br> This is the first book to trace the fascinating parallel history of law and science from antiquity to modern times, showing how the two disciplines have always influenced each other&#x2014;until recently. In the past few decades, science has shifted from seeing the natural world as a kind of cosmic machine best understood by analyzing each cog and sprocket to a systems perspective that views the world as a vast network of fluid communities and studies their dynamic interactions. The concept of ecology exemplifies this approach. But law is stuck in the old mechanistic paradigm: the world is simply a collection of discrete parts, and ownership of these parts is an individual right, protected by the state. Capra and Mattei show that this has led to overconsumption, pollution, and a general disregard on the part of the powerful for the common good. <br><br> Capra and Mattei outline the basic concepts and structures of a legal order consistent with the ecological principles that sustain life on this planet. This is a profound and visionary reconceptualization of the very foundations of the Western legal system, a kind of Copernican revolution in the law, with profound implications for the future of our planet.</p><p>Bestselling author Fritjof Capra partners with distinguished legal scholar Ugo Mattei to reveal that our legal system must catch up with the current scientific under-standing of the world if it is to contribute to solving the great crises of our times.Fritjof Capra, PhD, is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001. He lives in Coventry, England.Defining mathematics as a system of thought for recognizing and exploiting patterns, Scientific American math columnist Stewart takes readers on an exciting, lucid voyage of discovery as he investigates patterns of form, number, shape and movement in the world around us. His examples range from water dripping slowly from a tap to the symmetries of molecules, viruses and galaxies and from a snail's spiral shell to biological evolution and the dynamics of solar systems. Making forays into the history of mathematics and the role of mathematics in human culture, Stewart gives the reader an uncanny feel for the way mathematicians think and provides a succinct yet remarkably broad overview extending from the invention of numbers to unsolved problems that bedevil contemporary mathematicians and cosmologists. His elegant narrative concludes with a look at today's emerging sciences of chaos and complexity, which reveal that nature's seeming anarchy is bound by rules.

Unlike earlier approaches to the subject that have viewed prophecy separately from other forms of divination, Hamori&#x2019;s study encompasses the full range of divinatory practices and the personages who performed them, from the female prophets and the medium of En-dor to the matriarch who interprets a birth omen and the &#x201c;wise women&#x201d; of Tekoa and Abel and more.

Lewis,&nbsp;Johns Hopkins University (Theodore J. Lewis)<br><br>"Divination is an elusive and probably for many readers an insignificant phenomenon in the Hebrew Bible, but in Esther Hamori's hands, it comes to life as something fundamental to the world views of the biblical authors. With considerable erudition, lightly worn, and even more, great and penetrating discernment, Hamori gathers the biblical texts at issue, and shows how many-sided a phenomenon divination was in the Hebrew Bible and how varied, even contradictory, the biblical attitudes toward it were. Hamori is an outstanding reader of the ancient texts. Patiently and meticulously, she can crawl inside them and illuminate what they say and do not say. In the process, she carries on a lively conversation with previous interpreters, able and willing to build both on their insights and, as she gently but firmly demonstrates, on where they have gone astray. At the same time, she understands the importance of comparative study, and in a series of judicious forays into such other ancient Near Eastern cultures as the Mesopotamian and the Hittite, she finds just the analogy that will clarify what the often elliptical biblical text is assuming &#x2013; all the while very much aware of the dangers of pressing the analogy too far. In sum, Hamori has not only opened up the phenomenon of divination in the biblical world in new and fascinating ways, but given us a model analysis that has ramifications for many other fields of study."&#x2014;Peter Machinist, Harvard University<br> &nbsp;<br> (Peter Machinist)</p><h2>The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination (Mrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman Memorial Lectures)</h2><p>The Silliman Memorial lecture series was established in 1888 in memory of Mrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman, the wife of Gold S.

In reevaluating its preoccupation with issues of church and state, Abanes uncovers the political agenda at Mormonism&#39;s core: the transformation of the world into a theocratic kingdom under Mormon authority. This illustrated edition has been revised and offers a new postscript by the author.</p><p>Many people believe that Mormonism, also known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), is just another Christian denomination seeking the world's betterment. But there was a time in America when the Mormon church was seen as little more than a cult-like collection of polygamous, religious zealots seeking the political overthrow of the United States. This aspect of Mormon history, dating back to Palmyra, New York, in the early 1800s, is but one facet of an enthralling saga laced with all the elements of an action-packed Hollywood movie: sex, lust, violence, greed, murder, deceit, and betrayal. Nevertheless, Mormonism has managed to emerge as one of the world's wealthiest and most influential religions. In fact, it wields more economic power more effectively than any other organized religion in existence. <p>Now, investigative religion journalist Richard Abanes -- author of End-Time Visions: The Road to Armageddon? and a highly regarded authority on cults, the occult, new religious movements, and the religious fringe -- examines the fascinating history of Mormonism in its entirety. Using exhaustive documentation, Abanes reveals the origins of Mormonism, the socioeconomic factors that contributed to its growth, its ongoing political agenda, and its religious teachings. Moreover, Abanes details what may be some of the most intriguing, yet rarely discussed, events in LDS history that continue to make it one of the most controversial of all religions. </p><p>One Nation Under Gods will appeal to anyone interested in Mormon history, cults, the religious evolution of the United States, and humanity's perennial desire to find spiritual fulfilment -- a desire too often pursued at any cost.</p>"Richard Abanes succeeds in detailing not just the LDS Church's quest for religious supremacy, but also its desire for economic and political dominance in order to pave the way for the Kingdom of God on Earth. Joseph Smith's occult practices, the creation of the Book of Mormon, the mysterious Danite assassins, Joseph Smith's murder, the Mormon move to Utah, blood atonement killings, polygamy, Mormon cover-ups and conspiracies -- all are discussed in this volume. One Nation Under Gods is a well-written and absorbing book that is ideal for anyone wanting a concise, accurate, and easy-to-understand history of Mormonism from its inception to the present."<br> SANDRA TANNER<br> Great-Great Grandchild of Brigham Young <p>This book is sure to stir up things in both the Mormon and Christian religious communities. No one challenges accepted religious doctrines, ideologies, and behaviors more cogently and bravely than Richard Abanes, and with One Nation Under Gods he has once again triumphed in bringing to light matters most religious leaders would rather leave buried. One Nation Under Gods is a triumph of research and wisdom."<br> MICHAEL SHERMER<br> Publisher of Skeptic Magazine and author of<br> How We Believe: The Search for God in An Age of Science </p><p>Abanes has produced a unique and fascinating book that reveals not only the true and complete history of Mormonism from its nineteenth century origins to the 2002 Olympics, but also documents many of those rarely discussed aspects of Mormon history known only to serious investigators of Mormonism's past. Although One Nation Under Gods is documented as meticulously as any scholarly work, it reads more like the screenplay to a fast-paced action movie.

They come in many shapes: loving a man or a woman who will not commit to us, being heartbroken when we're abandoned by a lover, engaging in Sisyphean internet searches, coming back lonely from bars, parties, or blind dates, feeling bored in a relationship that is so much less than we had envisaged - these are only some of the ways in which the search for love is a difficult and often painful experience. <p>Despite the widespread and almost collective character of these experiences, our culture insists they are the result of faulty or insufficiently mature psyches. For many, the Freudian idea that the family designs the pattern of an individual's erotic career has been the main explanation for why and how we fail to find or sustain love. Psychoanalysis and popular psychology have succeeded spectacularly in convincing us that individuals bear responsibility for the misery of their romantic and erotic lives. The purpose of this book is to change our way of thinking about what is wrong in modern relationships. The problem is not dysfunctional childhoods or insufficiently self-aware psyches, but rather the institutional forces shaping how we love.</p> <p>The argument of this book is that the modern romantic experience is shaped by a fundamental transformation in the ecology and architecture of romantic choice. The samples from which men and women choose a partner, the modes of evaluating prospective partners, the very importance of choice and autonomy and what people imagine to be the spectrum of their choices: all these aspects of choice have transformed the very core of the will, how we want a partner, the sense of worth bestowed by relationships, and the organization of desire.</p> <p>This book does to love what Marx did to commodities: it shows that it is shaped by social relations and institutions and that it circulates in a marketplace of unequal actors.</p></p><p><b>Eva Illouz</b> is Rose Isaac Chair of Sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality.

Clarke and C.S. Lewis</h2><p><p>From Narnia to Space Odyssey is the dialogue of letters between Arthur C. Clarke and C.S. Lewis in which they debate, discuss, and ponder the potential and potential dangers of the rise of technology. Their encounter sets the stage for much of what we face today: is technology the "beauty" that will lead to a more utopian society, or is it the "beast" that endangers our humanity and spirit? </p><p> Clarke and Lewis began their correspondence in December 1943 when Clarke took Lewis to task for his remark about "little rocket societies bent on exporting the crimes of mankind to other planets." While they met only once (at a well-known pub in Oxford, with Lewis bringing along a good friend-the Oxford don, one J.R.R. Tolkein), their "encounters" lasted until 1954 when Clarke became involved in underwater exploration and left for the Great Barrier Reef. Their concern about the future of society, even from differing perspectives, is both provocative and illuminating, and bears close reading today when we are all confronted with the question whether mankind can control the explosion of technology or will become its slave. </p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology</h2><p><p> <b> </b> In this book, Quirk and Serda introduce the terminology, concepts, processes, products, and equipment commonly used in the manufacture of ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) semiconductors. <b> </b> The book provides helpful, up-to-date technical information about semiconductor manufacturing and strikes an effective balance between the process and equipment technology found in wafer fabrications. Topics include copper interconnect; dual damascene additive process for metallization; deep <i>UV</i> sub-micron photolithography (.18 micron and below); low-k dielectric processing; chemical mechanical planarization; a comprehensive model of manufacturing process; chemical-mechanical polish (CMP); and maintenance and troubleshooting. <b> </b> For practicing semiconductor manufacturing technicians or those interested in semiconductor manufacturing technology and processes. </p></p><p>PREFACE <p> This text started with a simple premise: as instructors, we need to teach relevant microchip technology to students and employees in semiconductor manufacturing. Unfortunately, in the semiconductor industry, changes in technology are measured in months, not years. Our challenge was to write a relevant book that would not be outdated by the time it was published. With that in mind, we researched the material and applied ourselves to writing the chapters and creating the artwork. Following the aggressive pace of Moore's law, the technical material in our book is at most only 18 to 24 months old. This permits us to keep abreast of the changing technology nodes swirling through the semiconductor industry. </p><p> This text is written for students in two-year and four-year technology programs at community colleges and universities. The text will also be a practical reference as well as a standard text in corporate and technical training classes. Students are expected to have an understanding of high school chemistry, physics, and math. Chapters are organized around the broad technologies applicable to semiconductor manufacturing. ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT </p><p> Our goal is to accomplish three objectives:</p><p>Help technology students grasp the fundamental technologies used in manufacturing semi conductor devices. Present some of the many challenges in microchip fabrication. Instill in the reader an appreciation of the conceptual simplicity of semiconductor manufacturing. </p><p> All fundamental technical information relevant to semiconductor manufacturing is first presented in Chapters 1 to 8. Chapter 9 presents a process model overview with a general flowchart that links the major areas in a wafer fab. Chapters 10 to 19 cover each of the major processes in the fab. Finally, Chapter 20 provides an overview of the back-end process for IC assembly and packaging. The content in the process chapters (Chapters 10 to 20) addresses critical process technology, followed by the various equipment designs needed to support this technology. Each process chapter concludes with a summary of quality measures and troubleshooting issues to familiarize the student with the practical, day-to-day challenges encountered during wafer fabrication. </p><p> The latest technologies for sub-0.25 um processing are covered in detail. This includes chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), shallow trench isolation (STI), chemically amplified deep UV photoresists, step-and-scan systems, copper metallization with dual damascene, and the widespread move to process integration with cluster tools. Throughout the text, we explain all process and equipment technology in light of the long history of change in the industry. Early tools and processes are described to clarify the development of current technology. In some cases, the linkage between the latest equipment and earlier tools is obvious, while in other instances the change is dramatic. </p><p> Professors, students, and other readers of this book can send comments or questions about this text to the authors at the following website: smtbook. We look forward to any exchange of information that can help advance semiconductor manufacturing education.</p><p>This book is written for students in two- and four-year technology programs at community colleges and universities.

An enormous amount of relevant new research has been published since the first edition of <em>Principles of Animal Communication</em>, and over 90% of the citations in this new edition were published since the first edition appeared.<br><br>Although the basic order of topics is similar, this second edition is a completely new book. The topics in the 26 chapters of the first edition have been condensed and integrated into 16 chapters in the new version so as to better accommodate upper-division undergraduate courses with 15-week semesters. The text omits boxes and, instead, the relevant mathematics, more advanced considerations, citation bibliographies, and web links for topic enrichment have been assembled into chapter-specific and freely accessible web modules. This was done to improve the flow for undergraduates, while still providing access to more technical details and scholarly sources for graduate courses and professional users. Figures and photos are now full-color and the book has a larger format that makes for easier reading. This edition retains the broad taxonomic and sensory scope of the first edition and even adds coverage of several modalities and taxa not discussed in the first edition. As with the first edition, every chapter concludes with an itemized summary of major points and suggestions for additional reading.<br><br>As the title suggests, the emphasis in the text is on identifying general principles that apply broadly across taxa and modalities. At the same time, major effort has been expended to integrate these principles with the accepted principles of economics and other fields of science. Given this integrative nature, animal communication is a topic that can serve both as an appealing entry point to science for younger students and as a coalescing of separate disciplines for more senior ones.<br><strong>For Students</strong><br><br><strong>Companion Website</strong><br><br>New for the second edition, the <em>Principles of Animal Communication</em> Companion Website is freely accessible to all students and includes:<br><br>* Chapter Outlines for a quick overview of each chapter.<br>* Chapter Summaries for review of each chapter's main concepts.<br>* Web Topics that provide additional coverage and background material on a variety of topics throughout the textbook.<br>* Literature Cited for all works cited in the textbook.<br><br> <strong>For Instructors </strong>(Available to Qualified Adopters)<br><br><strong>Instructor's Resource Library</strong><br><br>The new Instructor's Resource Library disc includes all of the textbook's figures and tables (including photos) as both high- and low-resolution JPEG images, formatted and optimized for projection.

A small people inhabiting a country poor in resources and divided into hundreds of quarreling states created one of the most remarkable civilizations. Comprehensive and balanced, <em>A Brief History of</em> <em>Ancient Greece: Politics, Society, and Culture</em> is a new and shorter version of the authors' highly successful <em>Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History</em> (OUP, 1998). Four leading authorities on the classical world offer a lively and up-to-date account of Greek civilization and history in all its complexity and variety, covering the entire period from the Bronze Age through the Hellenistic Era, and integrating the most recent research in archaeology, comparative anthropology, and social history. They show how the early Greeks borrowed from their neighbors but eventually developed a distinctive culture all their own, one that was marked by astonishing creativity, versatility, and resilience. The authors go on to trace the complex and surprising evolution of Greek civilization to its eventual dissolution as it merged with a variety of other cultures. Using physical evidence from archaeology, the written testimony of literary texts and inscriptions, and anthropological models based on comparative studies, this compact volume provides an account of the Greek world that is thoughtful and sophisticated yet accessible to students and general readers with little or no knowledge of Greece. <br> <br> Ideal for courses in Greek Civilization and Ancient Greece, <em>A Brief History of Ancient Greece</em> offers:<br>� A more streamlined treatment of political and military history than <em>Ancient Greece</em><br>� Emphasis on social and domestic life, art and architecture, literature, and philosophy<br>� Expanded coverage of women and family life, religion, and athletics<br>� A new section on male homosexuality in ancient Greece<br>� A revised art program featuring more than 100 illustrations and 17 original maps<br>� Numerous "document boxes" that include primary source material <br></p><p>Sarah B.

But she can't stop herself from secretly recording all of her hilarious adventures and coming-of-age heartbreaks. When the local paper gets ahold of her writing and offers her an exciting opportunity, Emily will have to decide how much she's willing to sacrifice as she climbs towards her dreams. </p> <p>This new edition lovingly restores the original, unabridged text and includes an all-new, exclusive introduction with special memories from L.M. Montgomery's granddaughter.</p> <p><strong>What Readers Are Saying:</strong></p> <p>"A spunky, mysterious, and lightly romantic read."</p> <p>"There is much more to this book than anyone would expect&#x2015;wonderful, complex characters and very subtle, sly underlying themes."</p> <p>"Five stars for being beautiful, inspiring, funny, and magical."</p></p><p>Emily Starr was born with the desire to write. As an orphan living on New Moon Farm, writing helped her face the difficult, lonely times. But now all her friends are going away to high school in nearby Shrewsbury, and her old-fashioned, tyrannical aunt Elizabeth will only let her go if she promises to stop writng! All the same, this is the first step in Emily&#39;s climb to success. Once in town, Emily&#39;s activities set the Shrewsbury gossips buzzing. But Emily and her friends are confident -- Ilse&#39;s a born actress, Teddy&#39;s set to be a great artist, and roguish Perry has the makings of a brilliant lawyer. When Emily has her poems published and writes for the town newspaper, success seems to be on its way -- and with it the first whispers of romance. Then Emily is offered a fabulous opportunity, and she must decide if she wants to change her life forever.L.M. Montgomery achieved international fame in her lifetime that endures well over a century later. A prolific writer, she published some 500 short stories and poems and twenty novels. Most recognized for Anne of Green Gables, her work has been hailed by Mark Twain, Margaret Atwood, Madeleine L&#39;Engle and Princess Kate, to name a few. Today, Montgomery&#39;s novels, journals, letters, short stories, and poems are read and studied by general readers and scholars from around the world. Her writing appeals to people who love beauty and to those who struggle against oppression.</p><h2>Organized Crime</h2><p>ORGANIZED CRIME, 10th Edition provides a detailed, comprehensive analysis of the origins, history, theoretical explanations, and structure of domestic and international organized crime.

He spun the steering wheel back and forth with one beefy hand, and with the other deftly shifted gears like a race car driver as we sped down the narrow, winding streets of this moldering tropical city.<br><br>I knew that even though we couldn't see them in the dark, every structure we passed was mildewed and slowly crumbling back into the black loam and teeming vegetation from where it had come long before the British carved out their colonial outpost here more than a century ago.<br><br>Maxwell, a large man with sloping shoulders, was slouched against the right-hand door, on the driver's side of the old car. He had borrowed this wreck from one of the office secretaries for his nighttime forays. He was wearing a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, a Band-Aid mustache, and a floppy hat, one of the many quick-change disguises that I had devised for him and his intelligence sources to use for their meetings after dark. Such subterfuge was the only way CIA officers could meet their assets -- locals recruited by U.S. intelligence -- in this hostile environment.<br><br>Maxwell would sometimes have eight or nine operational meetings a night, which pushed the bounds of good security practices. Most meetings took place in the old car while he drove his asset around on the back streets, debriefing them while continuing to run surveillance-detection runs -- SDRs, as they are known in the spy trade -- to ensure they weren't being followed.<br><br>Tonight was a special trip. We would be breaking new ground on this case, and thanks to my disguises, Maxwell would be bringing his best agent home for a sit-down meeting in the civilized surroundings of his house, an almost unheard of luxury.<br><br>We were approaching a double corner as we passed the swimming club where Maxwell would execute a rolling car pickup. He slowed down, pressed on the brake pedal long enough for the forward motion of the car to be interrupted for half a heartbeat. He timed this stop to occur just as he passed behind the hedge on our left, next to the corner of the club building.<br><br>A dark figure moved out from behind the hedge at the same instant and entered the left front passenger door as I opened and closed it in one motion. The dome light had not come on.<br><br>The figure crouched safely on the floorboard of the car as Maxwell released his pressure on the brake pedal and our momentum carried us forward again. He pressed smoothly on the accelerator, and we continued on a circuitous route to the residential district out by the lake to our first destination.<br><br>The top-secret GAMBIT disguise was positioned on my lap. I had created it for the man at an earlier meeting, and I hoped to conduct a final fitting tonight. I planned to do this in the dark car as we moved along, in case we passed someone who knew him.<br><br>We started down a deserted stretch, and the man code-named SAPPHIRE had crawled up off the floor and was now sitting up directly in front of me. He knew what to expect as I reached over to show him how to put on the disguise. By the time Maxwell arrived at his cover stop, I had made final adjustments to SAPPHIRE's new persona and was handing him a small leather-bound credential, which he reviewed, then slipped into his pocket.<br><br>The houseboy and gate man at the cover stop didn't give us a second look as we waited in the car chatting while Maxwell made his phantom delivery to a friend, the cover reason for this trip.<br><br>Shortly, we were headed back to Maxwell's house, where I had been staying since my arrival from Washington, D.C. We had rounded a corner and were proceeding down a side street behind an enormous golden stupa, a Buddhist shrine, that marked the center of town.<br><br>Suddenly we were caught in the high beams of a vehicle blocking the center of the road. There were two uniformed and armed soldiers standing in front of the headlights of a camouflaged scout car. They signaled us to halt.<br><br>Maxwell stood on the brakes, and the ancient car lurched to a stop.<br><br>One of the military men approached the car on the passenger side and rapped on the glass with his swagger stick. SAPPHIRE rolled down the window, and the officer leaned his head so far into the car I was sure they would touch noses.<br><br>But he was not looking at SAPPHIRE at all. Instead, his gaze was focused on Maxwell.<br><br>"Evening, sir. May I see your papers?"<br><br>Maxwell presented his credential, handing it over in front of SAPPHIRE.<br><br>The officer shined his light on it, and then returned it. "Very good, sir. And what about these two gentlemen?"<br><br>Both SAPPHIRE and I were ready with our documents as well. His were in the credential case that I had given him minutes earlier.<br><br>After a quick look, the officer handed both of them back to SAPPHIRE and snapped to attention. "Thank you, Excellency," he said.<br><br>SAPPHIRE saluted back, and we were soon on our way.<br><br>A little later, we were relaxing over drinks at Maxwell's place, reliving the events of the evening. Maxwell suddenly turned to me. "By the way," he said, "that officer was awfully impressed with SAPPHIRE. What was that all about?"<br><br>"I knew the disguise would make him look older and distinguished," I said, "so I made him an attach� from an Eastern European country -- with the rank of general."<br><br>SAPPHIRE smiled, enjoying the promotion that he had carried off perfectly.<br><br>The young Russian KGB officer already had a distinct military bearing.<br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Antonio J.

Aside from his more directly theoretical texts, however, case-studies of theatrical naturalism, the Bloomsbury group, advertising, science fiction, and the Welsh novel are also included as illustrations of the method at work. Finally, Williams&#x2019;s identity as an active socialist, rather than simply an academic, is captured by two unambiguously political pieces on the past, present and future of Marxism.</p><p><b>Raymond Williams</b> (1921&#x2013;1988) was for many years Professor of Drama at the University of Cambridge.

Solve for Happy is his first book.Solve for Happy Chapter One<p></p> Setting Up the Equation<p></p> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re rich or poor, tall or short, male or female, young or old. It doesn&#x2019;t matter where you come from, what you do for a living, what language you speak, or what tragedies you&#x2019;ve endured. Wherever you are, whoever you are, you want to be happy. It&#x2019;s a human desire about as basic as the drive to take the next breath.<br> <br>Happiness is that glorious feeling when everything seems right, when all of life&#x2019;s twists and turns and jagged edges seem to fit together perfectly. In those often all-too-brief flickers of genuine happiness, every thought in your head is agreeable, and you wouldn&#x2019;t mind if time stood still and the present moment extended forever.<br> <br>Whatever we choose to do in life is ultimately an attempt to find this feeling and make it last. Some people look for it in romance, while others seek it in wealth or fame, and still others through some form of accomplishment. Yet we all know of people who are deeply loved, achieve great things, travel the world, snap up all the toys money can buy, indulge in every luxury, and still long for the elusive goal of satisfaction, contentment, and peace&#x2014;also known as happiness.<br> <br>Why should something so basic be so hard to find?<br> <br>The truth is, it isn&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;re just looking for it in the wrong places.<br> <br>We think of it as a destination to reach, when in fact it&#x2019;s where we all began.<br> <br>Have you ever searched for your keys only to realize they were in your pocket all along? Remember how you removed everything from your desk, searched beneath the couch, and got more and more frustrated the longer they went missing? We do the same thing when we struggle to find happiness &#x201c;out there,&#x201d; when, in fact, happiness is right where it&#x2019;s always been: inside us, a basic design feature of our species.<br> Our Default State<p></p> <br>Look at your computer, smartphone, or other gadgets. They all come with preferences preset by the designers and programmers. There&#x2019;s a certain level of screen brightness, say, or a localized user interface language. A device fresh from the factory, set up the way its creators think best, is said to be in its &#x201c;default state.&#x201d;<br> <br>For human beings, simply put, the default state is happiness.<br> <br>If you don&#x2019;t believe me, spend a little time with a human fresh from the factory, an infant or toddler. Obviously, there&#x2019;s a lot of crying and fussing associated with the start-up phase of little humans, but the fact is, as long as their most basic needs are met&#x2014;no immediate hunger, no immediate fear, no scary isolation, no physical pain or enduring sleeplessness&#x2014;they live in the moment, perfectly happy. Even in distressed parts of the world, you can see children with dirty faces using little pebbles as toys or holding a cracked plastic plate as the steering wheel of an imaginary sports car. They may live in a hovel, but as long as they have food and a modicum of safety, you&#x2019;ll see them run around hooting with joy. Even in news coverage of refugee camps, where thousands have been displaced by war or natural disaster, the adults in front of the camera will appear grim, but in the background you&#x2019;ll still hear the sounds of kids laughing as they play soccer with a knot of rags for a ball.<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s not only kids. This default state applies to you too.<br> <br>Look back into your own experience. Summon up a time when nothing annoyed you, nothing worried you, nothing upset you. You were happy, calm, and relaxed. The point is, you didn&#x2019;t need a reason to be happy. You didn&#x2019;t need your team to win the World Cup. You didn&#x2019;t need a big promotion or a hot date or a yacht with a helicopter pad. All you needed was no reason to be unhappy. Which is another way of saying:<br> <br>Happiness is the absence of unhappiness.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s our resting state when nothing clouds the picture or causes interference.<br> <br>Happiness is your default state.<br> <br>When you use a programmed device, you sometimes change its default settings without meaning to, sometimes so much so that certain functions become more difficult to use. You install an app that frequently connects to the Internet, and your battery life decreases. You download malware, and everything starts to go haywire. The same thing happens with the human default for happiness. Parental or societal pressure, belief systems, and unwarranted expectations come along and overwrite some of the original programming. The &#x201c;you&#x201d; who started out happily cooing in your crib, playing with your toes, gets caught up in a flurry of misconceptions and illusions. Happiness becomes a mysterious goal you seek but can&#x2019;t quite grasp, rather than something simply there for you each morning when you open your eyes.<br> <br><br> <br>If we were to picture it, the times when you&#x2019;re unhappy are like being buried under a pile of rocks made up of illusions, social pressures, and false beliefs. To reach happiness, you need to remove those rocks one by one, starting with some of your most fundamental beliefs.<br> <br>As every person who&#x2019;s ever called Tech Support knows, sometimes the first step to bringing a device back to proper functioning is to restore the factory settings. But unlike our gadgets, we humans don&#x2019;t have a reset button. Instead, we have the ability to unlearn and reverse the effects of what went wrong along our path.<br> <br><br> <br>How did we ever get the idea that we have to look for happiness outside us, to strive for it, reach it, achieve it, or even earn it? How did we get things so terribly wrong that we&#x2019;ve accepted that happiness touches our lives only briefly? How did we let go of our birthright to be happy?<br> <br>The answer may surprise you: Perhaps that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve always been trained to do.<br> Solve for Happy<p></p> <br>You may have received sound advice like the kind my mother gave me, that I should study and work hard, save and be willing to defer certain forms of gratification to achieve certain goals. Her advice surely was a major contributor to my success. But I misunderstood. I thought she meant that I needed to defer happiness along the way. Or that happiness would be the result once I had achieved success.<br> <br>Some of the happiest communities in the world are actually in the poorer countries of Latin America, where people do not seem to think much at all about financial security or what we consider success. They work each day to earn what they need. But beyond that, they prioritize their happiness and spend time with their family and friends.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t mean to romanticize a life that appears quaint and colorful but still falls below the poverty line. But we can learn from a mind-set that weaves happiness into each day, regardless of economic conditions.<br> <br>I have nothing against material success. Human advancement has always been driven by innate curiosity, but also by the perfectly reasonable desire to store up enough resources to survive winter or a drought or a bad harvest. Thousands of years ago the more territory your family or tribe controlled and the better your skills at hunting and gathering, the better were your chances of survival. Thus the idea of sitting idle under the mango tree lost ground to the idea of innovating and hustling a bit, expanding one&#x2019;s territory, and building up a surplus, just in case.<br> <br>As civilization developed, more territory and more wealth usually meant better living conditions and the prospect of a longer life. Eventually, capitalism came along, reinforced by the Protestant ethic, which made prosperity a sign of God&#x2019;s favor. Individual effort and individual responsibility allowed the rise of what we now call income inequality, which increased the incentive to work even harder, if only to avoid being outpaced and crowded out by others. And once you&#x2019;d risen, you certainly didn&#x2019;t want to fall back. Because as the competition increased, the traditional supports that had provided security through the family or village eroded.<br> <br>The era just before our own saw the Great Depression and two world wars in quick succession, during which even those at the top of the income ladder had to worry about the basics. As a result, hardship shaped the priorities of an entire generation, underscoring the idea that what mattered most in life was to never endure such hardships again. The &#x201c;insurance policy&#x201d; most widely adopted and passed along was called &#x201c;success.&#x201d;<br> <br>Increasingly, as the twentieth century gave way to the twenty-first, the middle class raised their children to believe that the only logical course was to spend years in educational institutions to gain skills to be deployed in a lifetime of hard work in the hope of attaining security. We learned to make this path our priority, even if it made us unhappy, counting on the promise that when we finally achieved what society defined as success, then, at long last, we&#x2019;d be happy.<br> <br>Now, just ask yourself this question: How often do you actually see that happen? And instead, how often do you see a successful banker or business executive who&#x2019;s swimming in money but seems to be miserable? How often do you hear about cases of suicide of those who seemingly &#x201c;have it all&#x201d;? Why do you think this happens? Because the basic premise is flawed: success, wealth, power, and fame don&#x2019;t lead to happiness. As a matter of fact:<br> <br>Success is not an essential prerequisite to happiness.<br> <br>Ed Diener and Richard Easterlin&#x2019;s work on the correlation of subjective well-being and income suggests that, in the United States, subjective well-being increases proportionately to income&#x2014;but only up to a point. Yes, it feels lousy to have to work two jobs to be able to afford a tiny apartment and a beat-up Honda while paying off student loans. But once your income reaches the average annual income per capita, which in the United States today is about $70,000, subjective well-being plateaus. It&#x2019;s true that earning less can dampen your sense of well-being, but earning more is not necessarily going to make you any happier.1 Which suggests that all the expensive things advertisers say are the keys to happiness&#x2014;a better cell phone, a flashy car, a huge house, a status-worthy wardrobe&#x2014;really aren&#x2019;t so important.<br> <br>Not only are wealth, power, and lots of toys not prerequisites for happiness; if anything, the chain of cause and effect actually works the other way. Andrew Oswald, Eugenio Proto, and Daniel Sgroi from the University of Warwick found that being happy made people roughly 12 percent more productive and, accordingly, more likely to get ahead.2 And so:<br> <br>While success doesn&#x2019;t lead to happiness, happiness does contribute to success.<br> <br>And yet we continue to chase success as our primary goal. One of the earliest psychologists to focus attention on happy individuals and their psychological trajectory was Abraham Maslow. Back in 1933, he summed up our pursuit of success in one profound sentence: &#x201c;The story of the human race is the story of men and women selling themselves short.&#x201d;<br> <br>While a reasonable level of success is common in our society, those who achieve the highest levels of success often have one thing in common, one thing that differentiates them from the pack. They all, almost compulsively, love what they do. Many successful athletes, musicians, and entrepreneurs have achieved their success because they love what they do so much they become experts at it just because the activity itself makes them happy. As Malcolm Gladwell puts it in Outliers, if you spend ten thousand hours doing something, you become one of the best in the world at it.3 And what&#x2019;s the easiest way to spend so many hours on one thing? Doing something that makes you happy! Wouldn&#x2019;t that be better than spending a lifetime trying to reach success in hopes that it will eventually lead to happiness? At work, in our personal life, relationships or love life, whatever it is that we do, we should directly:<br> <br>Solve for Happy.<br> What Is Happiness?<p></p> <br>At my lowest point, back in 2001, I realized that I would never restore the happiness that was my birthright if I didn&#x2019;t at least know what I was looking for.<br> <br>So, being an engineer, I set out to develop a simple process to collect the data I needed to determine what made me happy. First, though, I hesitated because the technique was so simple it seemed almost childish. But then it occurred to me: if our model for the default condition of human happiness is the infant or toddler, maybe &#x201c;childish,&#x201d; or at least &#x201c;childlike,&#x201d; is not such a bad thing.<br> <br>I started by simply documenting every instance when I felt happy. I called it my Happy List. You might want to do the same thing. In fact, why not take a moment right now, pull out a pencil and a piece of paper, and jot down some of the things that make you happy. As assignments go, this one&#x2019;s not too tough. The list can be nothing more than a string of short, declarative sentences that get right to the point and complete the phrase<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel happy when ______________.&#x201d;<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t be shy. There&#x2019;s no reason to feel inhibited because no one ever has to see your list. You can include the obvious stuff, like scratching your dog under her chin or watching a beautiful sunset, and simple things like talking to your friends or eating scrambled eggs. There are no wrong answers. Write as many as you can think of.<br> <br>When you&#x2019;re done, at least for the first pass, go back and highlight a few items that, if you were forced to set priorities, would be at the top of the list of things that make you happiest. Those will make for a valuable short list that will prove useful in our later discussions.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s some good news already: the very act of creating your Happy List makes for a very happy experience, so much so that, when you&#x2019;re finished, you should feel energetic and refreshed. I work on my list at least once a week, adding new things. Not only does it put a smile on my face, but it helps me cultivate something that psychologists say contributes to happiness over the long haul: an attitude of gratitude, which happens when you acknowledge the truth about our modern lives and the fact that there is plenty to be happy about after all.<br> <br><br> <br>So go ahead and enjoy. I&#x2019;ll go make a cup of coffee and wait for you. (By the way, I feel happy when I enjoy a quiet cup of coffee!)<br> The Happiness Equation<p></p> <br>My hunch is that your list consisted almost entirely of ordinary moments in life&#x2014;a smile on your child&#x2019;s face, the smell of warm coffee first thing in the morning, the kinds of things that happen every day.<br> <br>So what&#x2019;s the problem? If the triggers for happy moments are so ordinary and so accessible, why does &#x201c;finding&#x201d; happiness remain such a big challenge for so many people?

In the late sixteenth century, Pope Gregory XIII instituted a momentous reform of Western timekeeping, and with it a period of great instability. Jews, like all minority cultures in Europe, had to realign their time-keeping to accord with the new Christian calendar.</p><p> </p><p> Elisheva Carlebach shows that the calendar is a complex and living system, constantly modified as new preoccupations emerge and old priorities fade. Calendars serve to structure time and activities and thus become mirrors of experience. Through this seemingly mundane and all-but-overlooked document, we can reimagine the quotidian world of early modern Jewry, of market days and sacred days, of times to avoid Christian gatherings and times to secure communal treasures. In calendars, we see one of the central paradoxes of Jewish existence: the need to encompass the culture of the other while retaining one&#x2019;s own unique culture. Carlebach reveals that Jews have always lived in multiple time scales, and demonstrates how their accounting for time, as much as any cultural monument, has shaped Jewish life.</p><p> </p><p> After exploring Judaica collections around the world, Carlebach brings to light these textually rich and beautifully designed repositories of Jewish life. With color illustrations throughout, this is an evocative illumination of how early modern Jewish men and women marked the rhythms and realities of time and filled it with anxieties and achievements.</p></p><p>Elisheva Carlebach is Salo W. Baron Professor of Jewish History, Culture, and Society at Columbia University.A remarkable and pioneering study of the Jewish calendar and its significance. Brilliantly researched, gracefully written, and timely -- in every sense of the word. (Jonathan D. Sarna, author of <i>American Judaism: A History</i>)<br><br>In a brilliant tour de force, Carlebach presents a masterful and penetrating analysis of the Jewish calendar as literature and material object, and as a dynamic, complex expression of cultural values, religious competition, social discipline, and personal meaning. (Lois Dubin, author of The Port Jews of Habsburg Trieste)<br><br>Focusing on the measure and meaning of time, Elisheva Carlebach has produced a work of enormous importance for all those interested in the convergence of humanistic and scientific knowledge. (Jay Berkovitz, author of <i>Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France, 1650-1860</i>)<br><br>This study of fascinating, richly illustrated manuscripts and early printed books opens up new horizons in the history not only of the Jewish calendar but also of the Hebrew book, Jewish daily life, personal piety, and the engagement of early modern Jews with surrounding Christianity. (Sacha Stern, author of <i>Calendar and Community: A History of the Jewish Calendar, 2nd Century BCE to 10th Century CE</i>)<br><br>Carlebach takes a narrow subject--sifrei evronot (European Jewish calendars/almanacs) of the 15th to 18th centuries--and mines it for its considerable riches. She demonstrates how these works reflected both Jews' values and beliefs and their interaction with the external Christian society...Carlebach is also particularly good at delving into Jewish folk beliefs as found in the calendars. She is equally illuminating on the calendars' iconography, illustrated by a 1716 calendar that shows the biblical Jepththah's daughter as a teenage European aristocrat...This well-organized and extensively researched book is a magnificent piece of scholarship and a pleasure to read, demonstrating the calendars' importance "as mirrors and agents of change,...indexes of acculturation, and...matchless reflections of the Jewish experience." (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i> 2011-01-24)<br><br>If you've ever wondered about the Jewish year and its history, Elisheva Carlebach's marvelous new book, <i>Palaces of Time: Jewish Calendar and Culture in Early Modern Europe</i>, has much to offer you. A preeminent specialist on the Jews of early modern Germany, Carlebach concentrates on what became of the calendar in the early modern period. In the 16th century and after, technical literature about time, which had once been treated as an esoteric knowledge reserved for an elite, became widely available to Jews for the first time, and Carlebach traces this process in detail. But as she reaches back to explain the distant origins of early modern debates and practices and sets the calendars into their larger contexts, <i>Palaces of Time</i> provides even more than it promises: a fascinating and provocative introduction, full of surprises, to the Jewish experience of time. Richly documented and sumptuously illustrated, the book tells a sinuous and sometimes wild story, one in which books of many kinds, in all their grubby materiality, play central roles...The book is exemplary. <i>Palaces of Time</i> is cultural history at its finest: a minutely observant, vivid, and passionately enthusiastic guide book to a world of experience that we--or at least most of us--have lost. (Anthony Grafton <i>Tablet Magazine</i> 2011-04-14)<br><br><i>Palaces of Time: Jewish Calendar and Culture in Early Modern Europe</i>, shows that Jews developed some of the most important theories and discovered some of the most fundamental mathematical underpinnings of early calendar setting. (Menachem Wecker <i>Jewish Press</i> 2011-08-10)<br><br>Calendars are the kind of object that are usually taken for granted, that are almost invisible to our everyday glance; therefore they are a perfect subject of analysis for cultural history. Very little good cultural history has been produced about Jewish subjects, and Elisheva Carlebach's book sets a very high standard for the field. Tackling a subject that is ubiquitous but also obscure, Carlebach looks at the topic of Jewish calendars from a number of perspectives. The actual calendrical aspects of the Jewish calendar, the references to non-Jewish dates that were incorporated into many calendars, the startling artistic traditions that are found in many early modern Jewish calendars--each subject is analyzed on its own, and placed in a diachronic and synchronic historical context, explaining how it developed from internal Jewish traditions while incorporating and responding to outside occurrences. Highlights include handwritten calendars from colonial America, symbolic pictures of elephants and bare-bottomed men, informative curses of Christian saints and statistics of fair attendance in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Despite the ostensibly obscure subject matter, <i>Palaces of Time</i> is as far from arcane as can be, written in language that is enjoyable and accessible. The numerous color photographs of Jewish calendars make the volume even more enjoyable and easier to follow. (Pinchas Roth <i>Jewish Book Council</i> 2011-11-28)<br><br>This meticulous study of manuscripts and printed books deals with Jewish ways of keeping time, especially during the 16th to l8th centuries in Western and Central Europe. (R.S. Kohn <i>Choice</i> 2011-12-01)<br><br>[An] admirable book, beautifully produced and brimming with fascinating pictures and extraordinary facts...[Carlebach] weaves a thoroughly-researched tale of adventures and frequent mishaps in cross-cultural negotiation between Jewish communities and their host societies over several centuries; dealing also with ideological battles, where Christian polemicists attacked Judaism through calendar issues. Anti-Semitic coercion even extended to calendar censorship which could prohibit publicizing rival foreign trade fairs and the sometimes amusing if not plain derogatory nicknames given to gentile festive days. The ubiquitous pocket luach, now so often replaced by an electronic version or a glance at the inside cover of a newspaper for notification of upcoming times and dates, is also dealt with in fascinating detail, its humble transience marked by tribulation and the acute survival instinct of our people under Nazi occupation in Tunisia in 1940 in Judaeo-Arabic and French, or secretly printed in Soviet-ruled Vilna. The book deals with much else of interest, giving a unique view and one of visual delight, ranging from weird and wonderful manuscript illustrations to a table with appropriately depicted "Zodiac man" giving propitious dates for bloodletting from a calendar published in Sulzbach as late as 1789. A worthy contribution to an under-researched subject presented with brio and elegant erudition, certainly one of the most important works of its kind to appear in recent years.

In <i>Compulsive Beauty</i>, Foster reads surrealism from its other, darker side: as an art given over to the uncanny, to the compulsion to repeat and the drive toward death. To this end Foster first restages the difficult encounter of surrealism with Freudian psychoanalysis, then redefines the crucial categories of surrealism&#x2015;the marvelous, convulsive beauty, objective chance&#x2015;in terms of the Freudian uncanny, or the return of familar things made strange by repression. Next, with the art of Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, and Alberto Giacometti in mind, Foster develops a theory of the surrealist image as a working over of a primal fantasy. This leads him finally to propose as a summa of surrealism a body of work often shunted to its margins: the dolls of Hans Bellmer, so many traumatic tableaux that point to difficult connections not only between sadism and masochism butal so between surrealism and fascism. At this point <i>Compulsive Beauty</i> turns to the social dimension of the surrealist uncanny. First Foster reads the surrealist repertoire of automatons and mannequins as a reflection on the uncanny processes of mechanization and commodification. Then he considers the surrealist use of outmoded images as an attempt to work through the historical repression effected by these same processes. In a brief conclusion he discusses the fate of surrealism today in a world become surrealistic. <i>Compulsive Beauty </i>not only offers a deconstructive reading of surrealism, long neglected by Anglo-American art history, but also participates in a postmodern reconsideration of modernism, the dominant accounts of which have obscured its involvements in desire and trauma, capitalist shock and technological development.</p></p><p>Hal Foster is Townsend Martin '17 Professor of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University and the author of <i>Prosthetic Gods</i> (MIT Press) and other books.<p>Breaking away from a critical tradition where for far too long gossip has competed with asymbolic grasps of ecstasy, Hal Foster's <i>Compulsive Beauty </i>will stand out in the literature devoted to Surrealism as the first convincing exploration of what is at the core of the Surrealist project: the status of the work of art in the age of psychoanalysis. If Surrealism was the last avant-garde to have cared about taking the pulse of a feverish beauty, Foster has discovered that it was beating, beyond the pleasure principle, to the uncanny beat of the death instinct.</p>&#x2015;<b>Denis Hollier</b>, Yale University<br><br><p>In exhilarating, thoughtful and subtle arguments, Foster takes surrealist interpretations of psychoanalysis into a shocking encounter with the Freudian uncanny...[An] extremely important book.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jane Beckett</b>, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></p><h2>Directors Tell the Story: Master the Craft of Television and Film Directing</h2><p><p>Move over, movies: the freshest storytelling today is on television, where the multi-episodic format is used for rich character development and innovative story arcs.&nbsp;<b>Directors Tell the Story </b>offers rare insight and advice straight from two A-list television directors whose credits include <i>Monk, Grey's Anatomy, Desperate Housewives, Weeds,</i> and more.

There&#39;s something nasty at the heart of Britain. The earth is poisoned: radioactive waste is washing into the water supply, and Japanese knotweed is choking the grasslands. Ghastly housing estates are proliferating across the Home Counties and terrorists are hiding in the ditches. This is Britain at the end of the last century and at the birth of the new. Alison knows what is coming. She foresees the death of Princess Diana (an annoying presence who is just as confused on the other side as she was on this). Alison foresees the coming down of the twin towers. Alison Hart is a medium by trade: dead people talk to her and she talks back. With her flat-eyed, flint-hearted sidekick, Colette, she tours the dormitory towns of London&#39;s orbital road, passing on messages from dead ancestors: &#39;Granny says she likes your new kitchen units.&#39; But there are messages that Alison must keep to herself. Alison&#39;s ability to communicate with spirits is a torment rather than a gift. Behind her plump, smiling and bland persona is a desperate woman. She knows the next life holds terrors that she must conceal from her clients. Her days and nights are haunted by the men she knew in her childhood, the thugs and petty criminals who preyed upon her hopeless, addled mother. As the spirits become stronger and nastier it becomes clearer that there are terrible secrets about to be revealed. Who is Alison? Why is she so keen to perform a good deed in a desperate world? What terrible thing was it that she did as a child? Why is she drawn to the cutlery drawer even now? This is Hilary Mantel&#39;s tenth novel and her first for six years. Beyond Black is an hilarious and deeply sinister story of dark secrets and dark forces, set in an England that jumps at its own shadow, a country whose banal self-absorption is shot through by fear of the coming, engulfing blackness.</p><p>Hilary Mantel was born in Derbyshire. She was educated at a convent and later studied law. After ten years abroad in Africa and the Middle East, she returned to Britain in 1985 to make a career as a writer.Beyond Black<br>oneTravelling: the dank oily days after Christmas. The motorway, its wastes looping London: the margin's scrub grass flaring orange in the lights, and the leaves of the poisoned shrubs striped yellow-green like a cantaloupe melon. Four o'clock: light sinking over the orbital road. Teatime in Enfield, night falling on Potter's Bar. There are nights when you don't want to do it, but you have to do it anyway. Nights when you look down from the stage and see closed stupid faces. Messages from the dead arrive at random. You don't want them and you can't send them back. The dead won't be coaxed and they won't be coerced. But the public has paid its money and it wants results.A sea-green sky: lamps blossoming white. This is marginal land: fields of strung wire, of treadless tyres in ditches, fridges dead on their backs, and starving ponies cropping the mud. It is a landscape running with outcasts and escapees, with Afghans, Turks and Kurds: with scapegoats, scarred with bottle and burn marks, limping from the cities with broken ribs. The life forms here are rejects, or anomalies: the cats tipped from speeding cars, and the Heathrow sheep, their fleece clotted with the stench of aviation fuel.Beside her, in profile against the fogged window, the driver's face is set. In the back seat, something dead stirs, and begins to grunt and breathe. The car flees across the junctions, and the space the road encloses is the space insideher: the arena of combat, the wasteland, the place of civil strife behind her ribs. A heart beats, taillights wink. Dim lights shine from tower blocks, from passing helicopters, from fixed stars. Night closes in on the perjured ministers and burnt-out pedophiles, on the unloved viaducts and graffitied bridges, on ditches beneath mouldering hedgerows and railings never warmed by human touch.Night and winter: but in the rotten nests and empty setts, she can feel the signs of growth, intimations of spring. This is the time of Le Pendu, the Hanged Man, swinging by his foot from the living tree. It is a time of suspension, of hesitation, of the indrawn breath. It is a time to let go of expectation, yet not abandon hope; to anticipate the turn of the Wheel of Fortune. This is our life and we have to lead it. Think of the alternative.A static cloud bank, like an ink smudge. Darkening air.It's no good asking me whether I'd choose to be like this, because I've never had a choice. I don't know about anything else. I've never been any other way.And darker still. Colour has run out from the land. Only form is left: the clumped treetops like a dragon's back. The sky deepens to midnight blue. The orange of the streetlights is blotted to a fondant cerise; in pastureland, the pylons lift their skirts in a ferrous gavotte.Copyright � 2005 by Hilary Mantel</p><h2>Job</h2><p>&#39;Many years ago there lived in Zuchnow, in Russia, a man named Mendel Signer.

Artists, architects, poets, inventors, scientists, and others all navigate the same stages of the process in order to discover something that does not yet exist. All of us must work our way through the empty page, the blank screen, writer's block, confusion, chaos, and doubt. In this book, Leski draws from her observations and experiences as a teacher, student, maker, writer, and architect to describe the workings of the creative process. </p><p>Leski sees the creative process as being like a storm; it slowly begins to gather and take form until it overtakes us&#x2015;if we are willing to let it. It is dynamic, continually in motion; it starts, stops, rages and abates, ebbs and flows. In illustrations that accompany each chapter, she maps the arc of the creative process by tracing the path of water droplets traveling the stages of a storm.</p><p>Leski describes unlearning, ridding ourselves of preconceptions; only when we realize what we don't know can we pose the problem that we need to solve. We gather evidence&#x2015;with notebook jottings, research, the collection of objects&#x2015;propelling the process. We perceive and conceive; we look ahead without knowing where we are going; we make connections. We pause, retreat, and stop, only to start again. To illustrate these stages of the process, Leski draws on examples of creative practice that range from Paul Klee to Steve Jobs, from the discovery of continental drift to the design of Antoni Gaud�'s Sagrada Familia. </p><p>Creativity, Leski tells us, is a path with no beginning or end; it is ongoing. This revelatory view of the creative process will be an essential guide for anyone engaged in creative discovery. </p><p><b>The Creative Process<br></b>Unlearning<br>Problem Making<br>Gathering and Tracking<br>Propelling<br>Perceiving and Conceiving<br>Seeing Ahead<br>Connecting<br>Pausing<br>Continuing</p></p><p>Kyna Leski is Professor in the Department of Architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design and a Founding Principal of 3six0 Architecture.<br><br>An internationally recognized leader at the intersection of design and technology, John Maeda is Executive Vice President/Chief Experience Officer at Publicis Sapient.

On the one hand, her focus on 'unlearning' takes us back to our most elemental moments of learning as a child, but also, on the other hand, to our most corrupted ideological predispositions. In her thinking, she develops critical mechanisms that braid the arts, sciences, and humanities to bring the various disciplines into conversation as part of the process of discovering.

The Temple is an astounding collection of verse poems: an extended meditation on man&#39;s relationship to God that is characterised by Herbert&#39;s clarity and directness of style. It includes such favourites as &#39;The Collar&#39;, &#39;The Pearl&#39; and &#39;Love&#39;, with its beautiful opening lines: &#39;Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back, / Guilty of dust and sin&#39;.</p><p>George Herbert (1593-1693) was a Welsh-born poet, orator and Anglican priest.

The chances are pretty good that this book came off a shelf containing a handful of similar baby care books, all claiming to be unique, authoritative, and invaluable. We make no such claims. This book may not be "essential" for caring for your baby. A lot of great parenting goes on without reference to a book. You could probably do a fine job of raising your children without advice from us. But if you're looking to do the best job you can as a parent, and do it with confidence in your parenting skills, you might find this book very useful indeed. Here's why. </p><p> The Hospital for Sick Children is the largest pediatric health science center in Canada, and one of the most respected in the world. Founded in 1875, Sick Kids (as it is widely known) has evolved into an international institution. Its stated mission is "to deliver exemplary patient care, train the next generation of child health leaders and develop new interventions and treatments." This goal is achieved through the efforts of more than 3,200 hospital staff members, 600 medical professionals, and 1,100 dedicated individuals at the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute. Trainees come from all over the world to learn the best and most up-to-date practices in child health care. </p><p> From this talented group, we have carefully selected eight contributors to produce this work. Seven are pediatricians, while one is a nurse practitioner. Three are men and five are women. All are parents; in fact, three have given birth in the last year. Some are community pediatricians with almost 30 years experience in primary care, while others are hospital-based. We also called on some of our highly skilled allied health professionals, including a dietitian, a lactation consultant, and a sleep expert, to review and augment relevant sections. In short, we wanted our authors to bring diverse perspectives to this book. The chief common denominator among this team of writers is pediatric expertise and a dedication to serving children. </p><p> Recruiting a capable group of experts was certainly a good start to the project, but it doesn't explain why this parenting book is so different. The complete answer requires a confession. When we were asked to write this book, we realized we had no particular ax to grind, cause to champion, or egos to stroke. Producing a book is hard work. Most books are written by people with a strong point of view. They feel the need to express their opinions, an innate personal bias often amplified by the fact that a book is more likely to sell if it is dramatically opinionated. </p><p> Our goal was not to present a strongly held dogmatic opinion, but rather to provide a clear, objective, and, above all, practical guide to help parents better raise a young infant. We want parents to use this book day in and day out. That's why you will find more "How to" and "Guide to" features in our book than in other baby care book. You can use this book to learn how to change a diaper, treat a cold, and feed with a bottle; how to select a stroller and purchase infant formula; and how to follow the curve of your baby's growth and development. We've even included a diary of one mother's experience with her infant son, from pregnancy to his first birthday, so you can compare the challenges and joys of parenting your baby. This book will help you build and hone your parenting skills, whether or not you have previous experience. </p><p> When it comes to questions about baby care, the advice offered by "authoritative" sources is often contradictory. It's a fact of life that, as soon as a couple announce they are expecting a baby, they are bombarded with unsolicited instructions that are usually confusing. This can be quite unsettling, undermining an expectant couple's confidence. What's a new parent to do? That's where this book comes in. It does not insist on a particular formula for parenting or extol only one rigid "best way" of doing things. Rather, it empowers parents with knowledge. It explains, informs, and demonstrates. We aimed to be comprehensive in presenting information and advice. Where possible, we incorporated the latest scientific "cutting edge" research findings. If there is no particular evidence to support a parenting practice, we present what is known so that parents can make informed choices that will work best for their particular circumstances. </p><p> We trust that the <i>Baby Care Book</i> will help replace uncertainty with knowledge, insecurity with confidence. We don't want you to do things our way; rather, we want you to feel comfortable raising your child in your own unique style. If this book helps you through the wonderful first year of your baby's life, we will be amply rewarded.

Edmund Burke&#x2019;s analysis of revolutionary change established him as the chief framer of modern European conservative political thought. This outstanding new edition of the <i>Reflections </i>presents<i></i>Burke&#x2019;s famous text along with a historical introduction by Frank M. Turner and four lively critical essays by leading scholars. The volume sets the <i>Reflections </i>in the context of Western political thought, highlights its ongoing relevance to contemporary debates, and provides abundant critical notes, a glossary, and a glossary-index to ensure its accessibility. Contributors to the book examine various provocative aspects of Burke&#x2019;s thought. Conor Cruise O&#x2019;Brien explores Burke&#x2019;s hostility to &#x201c;theory,&#x201d; Darrin McMahon considers Burke&#x2019;s characterization of the French Enlightenment, Jack Rakove contrasts the views of Burke and American constitutional framers on the process of drawing up constitutions, and Alan Wolfe investigates Burke, the social sciences, and liberal democracy.</p><p>Rethinking the Western Tradition SeriesThe French Revolution is a defining moment in world history, and usually it has been first approached by English-speaking readers through the picture painted of it by Edmund Burke. Reflections on the Revolution in France is a classic work in a range of fields from history through political science to literature, and securely holds its place among the canon of &#x201c;great books.&#x201d; Yet its meaning is still contested and often misunderstood, equally by those who wish to admire or to denigrate Burke for his present-day relevance. This edition aims to locate Burke once again in his contemporary political and intellectual setting. Alone among recent versions, it reprints the text of the first edition of the Reflections, and shows how Burke amended it as his knowledge of the Revolution deepened. It is certain to become the standard edition for scholars and students alike.<br>The editor&#x2019;s Introduction is much more extensive than that of any previous edition. It situates the Reflections in Burke&#x2019;s life and the development of his ideas, the history of English political thought, the debate about the French Revolution, and the debate the book itself inspired. But the Introduction is more than a compendium of information; it is a thoughtful, coherent interpretation of Burke and his book. The editor&#x2019;s notes are also fuller than those of any previous edition, glossing many literary and biblical allusions missed by previous editors.

Du Bois and the Black Social Gospel</h2><p>The black social gospel emerged from the trauma of Reconstruction to ask what a &#x201c;new abolition&#x201d; would require in American society. It became an important tradition of religious thought and resistance, helping to create an alternative public sphere of excluded voices and providing the intellectual underpinnings of the civil rights movement. This tradition has been seriously overlooked, despite its immense legacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this groundbreaking work, Gary Dorrien describes the early history of the black social gospel from its nineteenth-century founding to its close association in the twentieth century with W. E. B. Du Bois. He offers a new perspective on modern Christianity and the civil rights era by delineating the tradition of social justice theology and activism that led to Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p><b>Gary Dorrien </b>is the Reinhold Niebuhr Professor of Social Ethics at Union Theological Seminary and Professor of Religion at Columbia University, both in New York."Definitive . . . a capacious intellectual history . . . No reader will doubt the consummate professionalism of the scholarship, or the passion that Dorrien clearly has about the subject . . . with crisp narrative prose . . . gems of analysis and great personal stories from the often astonishing lives and deeply disturbing experiences of the protagonists."&#x2014;Paul Harvey, <i>Christian Century</i><br>&#x201c;Magnificent . . . <i>The New Abolition</i> brings to life those reformers whose work commenced after American slavery officially ended and the enterprise of re-creating slavery in new form was beginning.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jonathan Tran, <i>Christian Century</i><br>Winner of the 2017 Grawemeyer Award in Religion given by the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary<br>"A magisterial treatment of a neglected stream of American religious history presented by one of this generation&#x2019;s premier interpreters of modern religious thought performing at the top of his game."&#x2014;William Stacy Johnson, Princeton Theological Seminary &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"This is classic Dorrien&#x2014;beautifully written, cogent, and moving.&nbsp;Ever the careful historian, ethicist, and astute cultural critic, Dorrien has penned another must read book for general readers and scholars alike."&#x2014;Emilie M. Townes, Vanderbilt Divinity School<br>"Gracefully written and carefully researched, Dorrien's <i>The New Abolition</i> is an impressive recovery of W. E. B. Du Bois's relationship to the black social gospel. Anyone seeking to understand the historic contours of race, religion, and social activism in thetwentieth century absolutely must read this book."&#x2014;Juan M. Floyd-Thomas, Vanderbilt University<br>"Gary Dorrien&#x2019;s impressively researched and riveting account of W. E. B. Du Bois and the black social gospel is the most comprehensive treatment of an extremely crucial, yet woefully overlooked dimension of black political history and the role of black churches and religious thinkers within it. It changes our understanding of the religious and political history of African Americans and challenges churches and political institutions of today to reclaim the mantle and of the prophetic, at times even radical, mission of the black social gospel."&#x2014;Obery M.

Thus what began as a literary burlesque of British chivalry and culture grew into a disturbing satire of modern technology and social thought. The story of Hank Morgan, a nineteenth-century American who is accidentally returned to sixth-century England, is a powerful analysis of such issues as monarchy versus democracy and free will versus determinism, but it is also one of Twain&#39;s finest comic novels, still fresh and funny after more than 100 years.</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettes<p>In this classic satiric novel, published in 1889, Hank Morgan, a supervisor in a Connecticut gun factory, falls unconscious after being whacked on the head. When he wakes up and finds himself in Britain in 528, he is immediately captured, hauled back to Camelot, and sentenced to death.<br>But Hank is a quick-witted and enterprising fellow, and in the process of saving his life he turns himself into a celebrity of the highest magnitude. His Yankee ingenuity and knowledge of the world beyond the Dark Ages are regarded as the most powerful sorcery&#x2014;winning him the eternal enmity of a jealous Merlin. In an effort to bring democratic principles and mechanical knowledge to the kingdom, Hank introduces newspapers, telephones, bicycles, and other modern conveniences to the Dark Ages. But when he tries to improve the lot of the common people, chaos and war result, giving a bittersweet tone to this comic masterpiece by one of America's greatest storytellers.</p></p><h2>Five Plays: Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Chekhov's worldwide reputation as a dramatist rests on five great plays: <em>Ivanov, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters,</em> and <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>.

Tour.</p><p>From the moment he entered medical school in the late 1970s, people around Michael Swango thought he was a little odd. But even though he expounded upon his obsessions with violent death and serial killings to anybody within earshot, almost nobody connected him to the string of deaths among patients under his care. When an investigation finally took place at the Ohio State medical center, hospital administrators sympathized with Swango--against the direct testimony of patients and nurses--and seemed more concerned with how revelations of a murderous doctor might affect their public image than with the safety of their clients. And, remarkably, even after being released from prison in Illinois, where he had been convicted of (nonfatally) poisoning several of his coworkers, Swango was able to obtain positions at hospitals in South Dakota and New York. When American authorities finally started to pursue his case, he fled the country and began plying his trade in Zimbabwe. In June 1998, after being captured during an attempt to reenter the United States, he was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison--on fraud charges related to his employment in New York.<p> The truly frightening aspect of <i>Blind Eye</i> is not the relentless chain of murders, but the ease with which Swango was able to repeatedly slip through the cracks in the medical system, simply by lying about the nature of his felony conviction. James B. Stewart methodically traces every step of Swango's career, laying out a straightforward narrative with all the suspense of a well-crafted thriller. Although attempts to "explain" Swango's behavior through psychopathology and a historical rise in the incidences of serial killing derail the ending somewhat, <i>Blind Eye</i> is still a must-read for true crime buffs--or anyone who enjoys good journalism. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Author Photograph by Sigrid Estrada. <p> <b>James B.

Set in the English Midlands, the novel traces the lives of two sisters, Ursula and Gudrun, and the men with whom they fall in love. All four yearn for fufillment in their romantic lives, yet struggle in a world that is increasingly violent and destructive. Commenting on the novel, which was composed in the midst of the First World War in 1916, Lawrence wrote, "The bitterness of the war may be taken for granted in the characters." Rich in symbolism and lyrical prose, Women in Love is a complex meditation on the meaning of love in the modern world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the critic Alfred Kazin, "No other writer of [Lawrence's] imaginative standing has in our time written books that are so open to life."<br><br>D.

After the formation of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, in 1652, Fox and his associates suffered under brutal persecution from the English government. Fox's <i>Journal</i>, initially dictated to his stepson-in-law when they were both imprisoned in the mid-1670s, combines burning rage against social injustice and a visionary sense of God "rising" through all creation with a forthright account of his own persecution and suffering.

Four appendices--extracts from Fox's letters, descriptions of his travels in Ireland and America, and William Penn's Preface to the first printed edition--supplement the main text.</p><p>George Fox was born in 1624 in Leicestershire to a firmly Puritan family.

The strong-minded Bathsheba Everdene&#x2014;and the devoted shepherd, obsessed farmer, and dashing soldier who vie for her favor&#x2014;move through a beautifully realized late nineteenth-century agrarian landscape, still almost untouched by the industrial revolution and the encroachment of modern life.<br></p><p><p>Thomas Hardy (1840&#x2013;1928) was born in Dorset, England, son of a stonemason. Though a gifted student, he was unable to afford to attend university. He was apprenticed to an architect at age sixteen and worked in London for several years before returning to Dorset and dedicating himself to writing novels and poems.</p><b>Chapter I Description of Farmer Oak&#x2014;An Incident</b><br><br>When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun.<br><br>His Christian name was Gabriel,and on working days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good character. On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to postponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella: upon the whole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the parish and the drunken section,&#x2014;that is, he went to church, but yawned privately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene creed, and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood in the scale of public opinion, when his friends and critics were in tantrums, he was considered rather a bad man; when they were pleased, he was rather a good man; when they were neither, he was a man whose moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.<br><br>Since he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays, Oak&#x2019;s appearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own&#x2014;the mental picture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in that way. He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds, and a coat like Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s,4 his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large, affording to each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day long and know nothing of damp&#x2014;their maker being a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity.<br><br>Mr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch, what may be called a small silver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and a small clock as to size. This instrument being several years older than Oak&#x2019;s grandfather, had the peculiarity of going either too fast or not at all. The smaller of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round on the pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to. The stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes, and he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars, and by pressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours&#x2019; windows, till he could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within. It may be mentioned that Oak&#x2019;s fob being difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers (which also lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side, compressing the mouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion, and drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a well.<br><br>But some thoughtful persons, who had seen him walking across one of his fields on a certain December morning&#x2014;sunny and exceedingly mild&#x2014;might have regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these. In his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on to manhood: there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy. His height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his presence imposing, had they been exhibited with due consideration. But there is a way some men have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more responsible than flesh and sinew: it is a way of curtailing their dimensions by their manner of showing them. And from a quiet modesty that would have become a vestal, which seemed continually to impress upon him that he had no great claim on the world&#x2019;s room, Oak walked unassumingly, and with a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders. This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.<br><br>He had just reached the time of life at which &#x201c;young&#x201d; is ceasing to be the prefix of &#x201c;man&#x201d; in speaking of one. He was at the brightest period of masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated: he had passed the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse, and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again, in the character of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family. In short, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.<br><br>The field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe Hill. Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk-Newton. Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted yellow and gaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly. The waggon was laden with household goods and window plants, and on the apex of the whole sat a woman, young and attractive. Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss,&#x201d; said the waggoner.<br><br>&#x201c;Then I heard it fall,&#x201d; said the girl, in a soft, though not particularly low voice. &#x201c;I heard a noise I could not account for when we were coming up the hill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll run back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>The sensible horses stood perfectly still, and the waggoner&#x2019;s steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.<br><br>The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless, surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards, backed by an oak settle, and ornamented in front by pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses, together with a caged canary&#x2014;all probably from the windows of the house just vacated. There was also a cat in a willow basket, from the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and affectionately surveyed the small birds around.<br><br>The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up and down the perches of its prison. Then she looked attentively downwards. It was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an oblong package tied in paper, and lying between them. She turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming. He was not yet in sight; and her eyes crept back to the package, her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it. At length she drew the article into her lap, and untied the paper covering; a small swing looking-glass was disclosed, in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively. She parted her lips and smiled.<br><br>It was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair. The myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her were fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they invested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture, and girl with a peculiar vernal charm. What possessed her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators,&#x2014;whether the smile began as a factitious one, to test her capacity in that art,&#x2014;nobody knows; it ended certainly in a real smile. She blushed at herself, and seeing her reflection blush, blushed the more.<br><br>The change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an act&#x2014;from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors&#x2014;lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess. The picture was a delicate one. Woman&#x2019;s prescriptive infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had clothed it in the freshness of an originality. A cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though he fain would have been. There was no necessity whatever for her looking in the glass. She did not adjust her hat, or pat her hair, or press a dimple into shape, or do one thing to signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the glass. She simply observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which men would play a part&#x2014;vistas of probable triumphs&#x2014;the smiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won. Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any part in them at all.<br><br>The waggoner&#x2019;s steps were heard returning. She put the glass in the paper, and the whole again into its place.<br><br>When the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of espial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll. About twenty steps still remained between him and the gate, when he heard a dispute. It was a difference concerning twopence between the persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar.<br><br>&#x201c;Mis&#x2019;ess&#x2019;s niece is upon the top of the things, and she says that&#x2019;s enough that I&#x2019;ve offered ye, you great miser, and she won&#x2019;t pay any more.&#x201d; These were the waggoner&#x2019;s words.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well; then mis&#x2019;ess&#x2019;s niece can&#x2019;t pass,&#x201d; said the turnpike-keeper, closing the gate.<br><br>Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants, and fell into a reverie. There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably insignificant. Threepence had a definite value as money&#x2014;it was an appreciable infringement on a day&#x2019;s wages, and, as such, a higgling matter; but twopence&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; he said, stepping forward and handing twopence to the gatekeeper; &#x201c;let the young woman pass.&#x201d; He looked up at her then; she heard his words, and looked down.<br><br>Gabriel&#x2019;s features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot, as represented in a window of the church he attended, that not a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of distinction or notoriety. The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden seemed to think so too, for she carelessly glanced over him, and told her man to drive on. She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt none, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we know how women take a favour of that kind.<br><br>The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a handsome maid,&#x201d; he said to Oak.<br><br>&#x201c;But she has her faults,&#x201d; said Gabriel.<br><br>&#x201c;True, farmer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the greatest of them is&#x2014;well, what it is always.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Beating people down? ay, &#x2019;tis so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;O no.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What, then?&#x201d;<br><br>Gabriel, perhaps a little piqued by the comely traveller&#x2019;s indifference, glanced back to where he had witnessed her performance over the hedge, and said, &#x201c;Vanity.&#x201d;</p><h2>Rostam: Tales of Love and War from the Shahnameh (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><p><b>The selected adventures of Persia's Hercules, from Iran's great national epic</b><br><br> No understanding of world mythology is complete without acquaintance with Rostam, Iran's most celebrated mythological hero.

Miss Bunting, governess of choice to generations of Barsetshire aristocracy, has been coaxed out of retirement by Sir Robert and Lady Fielding to tutor their daughter Anne, delicate, sixteen years old, and totally lacking in confidence. </p><p>When Anne makes friends with Heather Adams, the gauche daughter of a nouveau riche entrepreneur, her mother is appalled. Miss Bunting, however, shows an instinctive understanding of the younger generation - perhaps, having lost so many of her former pupils to the war, she is more sympathetic to their needs. She may be a part of the old social order, where everyone knows their place, but is wise enough to realise that the war has turned everything on its head and nothing will ever be the same again - even in rural Barsetshire.<br>First published in 1945, <i>Miss Bunting</i> is a charming social comedy of village life during the Second World War.</p></p><p>Angela Thirkell (1890-1961) was the eldest daughter of John William Mackail, a Scottish classical scholar and civil servant, and Margaret Burne-Jones. Her relatives included the pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin, and her grandfather was J. M. Barrie. She was educated in London and Paris, and began publishing articles and stories in the 1920s. In 1931 she brought out her first book, a memoir entitled<i> Three Houses</i>, and in 1933 her comic novel <i>High Rising</i> - set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, borrowed from Trollope - met with great success. She went on to write nearly thirty Barsetshire novels, as well as several further works of fiction and non-fiction. She was twice married and had four children.From the '30s to the '60s, Thirkell wrote a novel a year, most of which were set in an updated version of Trollope's Barsetshire. This installment, originally published in 1945 is a mild and rather obvious comedy of manners set during one summer late in WWII, when traditional order is being brought to an end by the rise of industrial wealth and the damages inflicted by six years of war. The story revolves around a wide group of the upper class--primarily landowners and clergymen--who have dominated this small town, and how they will respond to arrival of a coarse but dynamic industrial tycoon. Miss Bunting is an elderly ex-governess who has been hired by one family to instruct and care for their 17-year-old daughter, Anne. This gentle comedy radiates out to encompass fictitious, "Mixo-Lydian" politics; the even more complicated goings-on of the C. of E.; and the entirely inscrutable underpinnings of British class structure. There are numerous characters, some dashing in and out of the narrative with such speed that the only thing they contribute is the memory of a vaguely humorous name. Some will find the book dated, but for Thirkell's many readers in this country, it will be a welcome addition to the growing library of her work. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Clymer Honda 50-110cc OHC Singles, 1965-1999: Service, Repair, Maintenance (Clymer Motorcycle)</h2><p>With the help of the&nbsp;<i>Clymer Honda 50-110Cc Ohc Singles, 1965-1999�??

Numerous exercises are provided at the end of every section; a partial solutions manual is available.A novel aspect of the book is the inclusion of working computer programs for many of the algorithms. Students will enjoy the interplay between practical programming issues and the latest theoretical developments; many student projects can be built on the provided code.&#34;It teaches the subject with the care and precision one hopes to find in the best colleges and universities. The development of the material is well placed, self-contained, and wonderfully motivated. The explanations flow at an unhurried pace and account for most any question one might have when meeting the subject for the first time....Teaching a course from this book must be a distinct pleasure.&#34; Christoph M. Hoffmann, SIAM Review</p><h2>Case Studies in Biomedical Ethics: Decision-Making, Principles, and Cases</h2><p>We are living in an unprecedented era of biomedical revolution. Medicine is remaking humans, and controversy surrounds such topics as abortion, artificial organs, brain circuitry, eugenics, euthanasia, and gene therapy. At the same time, medical advances are posing complex ethical problems for both patients and professionals.<br> The most comprehensive and up-to-date collection of its kind, <em>Case Studies in Biomedical Ethics: Decision-Making, Principles, and Cases</em> explores fundamental ethical questions arising from real situations faced by health professionals, patients, and others. Featuring a wide range of more than 100 case studies drawn from current events, court cases, and physicians' experiences, the book is divided into three parts. Part I presents a basic framework for ethical decision-making in healthcare, covering such issues as separating evaluative questions from questions of fact; distinguishing between ethical and nonethical evaluations; and identifying the source of ethical judgments. Expanding upon this framework, Part II explains the ethical principles: beneficence and nonmaleficence, justice, respect for autonomy, veracity, fidelity, and avoidance of killing. Parts I and II provide students with the background to analyze the ethical dilemmas presented in Part III, which features cases on a broad spectrum of issues including abortion, genetics, mental health, confidentiality, health insurance, experimentation on humans, the right to refuse treatment, and death and dying. Each case is accompanied by the authors' commentary, which guides students in considering the issues.<br> Ideal for undergraduate and graduate courses in biomedical ethics, bioethics, and medical ethics, <em>Case Studies in Biomedical Ethics</em> incorporates opening text boxes in each chapter that cross-reference relevant cases in other chapters. It also includes an appendix of important ethical codes and a glossary of key terms.</p><p>Robert M.

From awkward handshakes to having a girlfriend and everything in between, Shane handles his situation with humor and a "you-only-live-once" perspective on life. While he does talk about everyday issues that are relatable to teens, he also offers an eye-opening perspective on what it is like to have a life threatening disease.</p></p><p><p><b>Shane Burcaw</b> is a twenty-one-year-old with spinal muscular atrophy. He is currently a junior at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, studying English. Shane runs a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising money for muscular dystrophy research.</p>Gr 10 Up&#x2014;Burcaw is like any other 21-year-old guy. He loves sports, video games, and bathroom humor; enjoys hanging out with his friends; and has had several girlfriends. The only thing that makes him different is that he has done all of this while in a wheelchair. Burcaw was born with a rare neuromuscular disease known as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which hinders his muscles' ability to grow and repair themselves. Instead of growing bigger and stronger with age, he becomes weaker and smaller. As a result of the disease, Burcaw depends on his friends and family when it comes to completing everyday tasks. Throughout, he shares many humorous and touching stories about growing up and living with his disease. These tales leave nothing to the imagination, including descriptions of how he uses the bathroom or has sexual interactions, and the author occasionally employs some graphic language. Burcaw's narrative will resonate with readers, who will laugh along with the funny stories, cringe at the awkward moments, and tear up at the emotionally charged parts.

Intended primarily for college freshmen, this exceptionally lucid, carefully paced, elegantly designed, well-illustrated volume will appeal to curious readers of any age who want to know more about the innermost workings of the "central science." In the words of another advance reviewer, the Munowitz book "reveals the beauty of chemistry in an unusual, graceful, narrative style. Compared with standard textbooks, it is poetic." This book is unusual in several respects. Perhaps the most obvious, at first glance, is the distinctive pattern of white and gray stripes that appear when you view its pages edge-on. The striped pattern is a superficial manifestation of a novel's internal structure. Unlike a standard chemistry textbook, in which each chapter is fragmented into a hodgepodge of disparate parts--text, boxed features, worked exercises, solved and unsolved problems, in-chapter and end-of-chapter summaries, miscellaneous decorative elements-- each chapter in <em>Principles of Chemistry</em> has a much simpler organization: an uninterrupted narrative core (white pages), followed by a Review and Guide to Problems section (gray pages). In short: principles first, then practice. The tutorial, problem-solving sections at the ends of the chapters amount, in effect, to a built-in study guide, thus obviating the need for a separate volume of this type. In addition, the long run of predominantly white pages at the back of the book consists, for the most part, of an unusually complete set of appendices devoted to such important matters as nomenclature, mathematics, assorted tables, and a glossary. Taken just by themselves, then, the white pages that constitute the first, narrative parts of the book's 21 chapters add up to a fairly modest-sized book-within-a-book-- at least by comparison with other texts for the introductory general chemistry course. And what a book it is! As the reviewers' comments quoted elsewhere attest, the novel intrachapter organization of the Munowitz text contributes to another of this book's distinctive features: its remarkably coherent "story line." The main driving force here, though, is the extraordinary power and clarity of the author's writing by far the most remarked-upon special attribute of this book. Just crack it open anywhere and start reading, and you'll see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Michael Munowitz is currently a full-time science writer. A graduate of Yale College (summa cum laude, with distinction in chemistry), he obtained his Ph.D. in chemical physics from Harvard University and did postdoctoral work at the University of Leiden and the University of California, Berkeley. He has published more than 50 research papers in a variety of fields, including solid-state and two-dimensional NMR, computational chemistry, and waveguide design, and is the author of the book <i>Coherence and NMR</i>.Can Munowitz write or what! His hortatory, grab-'em-by-the-scruff-of-the-neck-and-don't-let-go-until-they-get-it style is great! It moves along and is not boring. Here is an author with enthusiasm and a point of view. The problems are even interesting I worked some out myself just for the fun of it. -- <i>John J. Alexander, University of Cincinnati</i><br><br>I particularly like the author's very careful and detailed discussions of the physical mechanisms behind the various equations that he presents. I know of no introductory textbook in which this is done as well. -- <i>Colin MacKay, Haverford College</i><br><br>If I wanted a student to learn the material on his or her own, I'd hand them Munowitz. -- <i>Robert Cave, Harvey Mudd College</i><br><br>Relegating the 'gritty practicality' to the review and problems section at the end of the chapter makes possible a more focused and seamless introduction to the concepts, which makes possible more engaging writing. The extended summary allows repetition and recapitulation of the concepts, which I think may enhance retention of the material. Clustering the problems and using an engaging 'dialogue' to introduce and relate them helps the students see a scientist's thinking modeled. -- <i>Michael Fuson, Denison University</i><br><br>The text reveals the beauty of chemistry in an unusual, graceful narrative style. Compared to standard textbooks, it is poetic.... The presentation of problems is unusual and particularly attractive.... By postponing instruction on problems until the end of the chapter, Munowitz avoids interruptions in the compelling narrative and invites undivided attention to the problems when they are addressed. The concise power of Munowitz's writing is most evident in the Introduction, which tells what chemistry is better than any other text I know. -- <i>Henry Griffin, University of Michigan</i><br><br>This is an amazing book. It's not just beautifully written or perfectly accurate or entrancing to read, although it is all that. What is more important is that it practices what it describes, namely the scientific search for truth. Munowitz's attention to the exact meanings of individual words mirrors a similar scrupulousness with respect to the macroscopic structure--the book. The effect is as captivating as a suspense novel. I have simply never come across a chemistry text so well written . . .. It is well known that most incoming freshmen who intend to major in science change their minds in the first year, probably because of the massive tedium of introductory curricula. Many manage to pass only by rote memorization of words that have no meaning for them--mass, force, energy, etc. This book has the capacity to change that. -- <i>Edward T. Samulski, University of North Carolina</i><br><br>[The Munowitz text] takes a principles-driven approach that displays the unity and coherence of the physical sciences by emphasizing the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic properties. The author writes with a crisp, direct, no nonsense, yet polished style. The analogies are appropriate, the imagery vivid, and the science accurate.... The book represents a paradigm shift and promises to be the text for the next millennium. -- <i>James Harrison, Michigan State University</i></p><h2>ARCO Mechanical Aptitude and Spatial Relations Tests</h2><p>The Mechanical Aptitude &amp; Spatial Relations Test offers training for success on exams that measure mechanical aptitude, symbol reasoning, and spatial relations for employment opportunities in the military, civil service, and private industry.

In these essays, Einstein views science as the basis for a "cosmic" religion, embraced by scientists, theologians, and all who share a sense of wonder in the rationality and beauty of the universe. <br>In the course of his career, Einstein wrote more than 300 scientific and 150 nonscientific publications. These essays date from the 1930s and 40s. In direct, everyday language the author develops a coherent view that transcends both the antiquated religion of fear and the modern religion of ethics. His concept of cosmic religion combines science and religion, with science forming the basis for a more enlightened religion. In these essays and aphorisms, Einstein also reflects on pacifism, disarmament, and Zionism. In addition to a brief biography of the author, this volume includes a warm appreciation by George Bernard Shaw.</p><p>In addition to conducting the research that culminated in his acclaimed theories of relativity, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) taught and lectured at universities around the world. Einstein received numerous awards and honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine, and philosophy, and he remains a towering symbol of intellectual and imaginative achievement. <p><b>It's All Relative <br></b>Around 1950, Hayward Cirker, Founder and President of Dover Publications, wrote to Einstein and asked his approval to proceed with a Dover paperback reprint of the 1923 collection of original papers on relativity by Einstein himself and others (H. A. Lorentz, H. Weyl, and H. Minkowski), which had originally been published in England. Einstein was reluctant, wondering how much interest there could possibly be in this relic of his work from 30 or more years earlier. Cirker persisted, and Einstein finally agreed &#x2014; the Dover edition of <i>The Theory of Relativity</i> has been in print ever since and has been followed by many other Dover books on relativity. </p><p> </p><p>The papers reprinted in this original collection will always be for the serious student the cornerstone of their Einstein library: Michelson's Interference Experiment (H.

The second chapter deals with the fundamental diagnostic and formulative issues. The third considers the development of the disorder in terms of childhood and adolescent antecedents. Basic treatment principles are presented in the fourth chapter, and the change process in reschematizing psychological treatment is addressed in the fifth. This last chapter presents a case in detail, indicating development of schemas of self and others; showing how core aspects of personality may change as a consequence of new forms of relationships and new uses of conscious thought. The initial phase of treatment in an average treatable case of hysterical personality is often one that is an urgent appeal for attention. This phase is followed quickly, once a therapeutic attachment is established, by a period of regression, in which unresolved conflicts and childhood fixations are manifested within the therapeutic relationship itself. Ideally, this phase overlaps with a period of working through, the therapeutic antidote to the multiply determined nature of the patient&#39;s state at onset of treatment. Finally, termination encompasses the difficult task of separation, itself a phase of important work on self-development for the hysterical personality. The approach here is that of brief or extended treatment guided by psychoanalytic theory, using the basic ground rules of psychodynamic psychotherapy. The main patient type under consideration is the hysterical personality who has developed a separate, although conflicted, self-representation and who has advanced capacity for relationship.
